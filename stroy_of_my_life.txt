INTRODUCTION
It is not my purpose to attempt a real autobiography or story of my
life. I simply want to tell the story of my numerous experiments with
truth, and as my life consists of nothing but those experiments, the story
will take the shape of an autobiography. My experiments in the political
field are now known. But I should certainly like to narrate my experiments
in the spiritual field which are known only to myself, and from
which I have derived such power as I possess for working in the
political field. The experiments I am about to relate are spiritual, or
rather moral; for the essence of religion is morality.
Only those matters of religion that can be understood as much by
children as by older people, will be included in this story. If I can
narrate them in a dispassionate and humble spirit many other experiments
will ... obtain from them help in their onward march.

EDITOR'S NOTE
Gandhiji's Autobiography* and his Satyagraha in South Africa+, as
published in English, run into almost 1000 pages. An abridgement++ of
these two into a single volume of 283 pages was published in 1952 by
the Navajivan Trust. A request was recently received for a still smaller
version for use in our schools. This book has been specially prepared to
meet the need.
Matters which are not likely to be of much interest to school children
have been omitted, and the language has been simplified where possible.
Topics for essays and discussions have been suggested at the end of
most of the chapters. They have been framed to suit both higher and
lower classes. Teachers may select from them the questions which are
within the capacity of their pupils to tackle. An interesting period may
be spent by the class discussing together one or other of the more
difficult topics, and then in another period the pupils may be asked to
write an essay on the topic.

PUBLISHER'S NOTE
In this reprint of the book, Grammar Exercises framed by Dr. C. N.
Zutshi have been omitted as they had been framed according to syllabuses
which have been greatly changed now-a-days. Topics for essays
and discussions have been placed chapterwise at the end of the book.
This book was originally prepared for use in our schools. The publisher
is happy to note that, owing to recent resurgence of interest in
Gandhiji, this book has been prescribed as one of the text-books for
certain general knowledge examinations by some voluntary educational
organizations. Hence it is expected that this reprint will have a wider
area of utility than the one that was originally intended for it.

“I have nothing new to teach the World.
Truth and non-violence are as old as hills.”
M. K. Gandhi
A
1
My father, Karamchand Gandhi,
was Prime Minister in Porbandar.
He was a lover of his clan, truthful,
brave and generous, but shorttempered.
He never had any ambition to
accumulate riches and left us very
little property.
He had no education. At best, he
might be said to have read up to
the fifth Gujarati standard. Of history
and geography he was innocent.
But his rich experience of
practical affairs stood him in good
stead in the solution of the most
intricate questions and in managing
hundreds of men. Of religious
training he had very little, but he
had that kind of religious culture
which frequent visits to temples
and listening to religious discourses
make available to many
Hindus.
The outstanding impression my
mother has left on my memory is
that of saintliness. She was deeply
religious. She would not think of
taking her meals without her daily
prayers. Going to Haveli – the
Vaishnava temple – was one of her
daily duties. As far as my memory
can go back, I do not remember
her having ever missed the
Chaturmas. She would take the
hardest vows and keep them whatever
happened. Illness was no excuse
for relaxing them. I can recall
her once falling ill when she was
PART I : CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH
1. BIRTH AND PARENTAGE
The house at Porbandar

observing the Chandrayana vow,
but the illness was not allowed to
come in the way of the observance.
To keep two or three fasts
one after another was nothing to
her. Living on one meal a day during
Chaturmas was a habit with
her. Not content with that she
fasted every other day during one
Chaturmas. During another
Chaturmas she vowed not to have
food without seeing the sun. We
children on those days would
stand, staring at the sky, waiting to
announce the appearance of the
sun to our mother. Everyone
knows that at the height of the
rainy season the sun often does not
show his face. And I remember
days when, at his sudden appearance,
we would rush and announce
it to her. She would run out to see
with her own eyes, but by that
time the sun would be gone, thus
depriving her of her meal. “That
does not matter,” she would say
cheerfully, “God did not want me
to eat today.” And then she would
return to her round of duties.
My mother had strong common
sense. She was well informed
about all matters of State.
Of these parents I was born at
Porbandar, otherwise known as
Sudamapuri, on the 2nd October
1869.
2. AT SCHOOL
I passed my childhood in
Porbandar. I remember having
been put to school. It was with
some difficulty that I got through
the multiplication tables. I recollect
nothing more of those days than
having learnt, in company with
other boys, to call our teacher all
kinds of names.
I must have been about seven
when my father left Porbandar for
Rajkot. There I was put into a primary
school, and I can well remember
those days. As at
Porbandar, so here, there is hardly
anything to note about my studies.
From this school I went to the suburban
school and thence to the
high school, having already
reached my twelfth year. I do not
remember having ever told a lie,
during this short period, either to
my teachers or to my schoolmates.
I used to be very shy and avoided
all company. My books and my
lessons were my sole companions.
To be at school at the stroke of the
hour and to run back home as soon
as the school closed, – that was
my daily habit. I literally ran back,
because I could not bear to talk to
anybody. I was even afraid lest
3
anyone should poke fun at me.
There is an incident which occurred
at the examination during
my first year at the high school
and which is worth recording. Mr.
Giles, the Educational Inspector,
had come on a visit of inspection.
He had set us five words to write
as a spelling exercise. One of the
words was ‘kettle’. I had misspelt
it. The teacher tried to prompt me
with the point of his boot, but I
would not be prompted. It was beyond
me to see that he wanted me
to copy the spelling from my
neighbour’s slate, for I had thought
that the teacher was there to supervise
us against copying. The result
was that all the boys, except myself,
were found to have spelt every
word correctly. Only I had
been stupid. The teacher tried later
to tell me that I should not have
been so stupid, but without effect.
I never could learn the art of
‘copying’.
Yet the incident did not in the
least lessen my respect for my
teacher. I was, by nature, blind to
the faults of elders. Later I came to
know of many other failings of
this teacher, but my regard for him
remained the same. For I had learnt
to carry out the orders of elders, not
to look critically at their actions.
Two other incidents belonging to
the same period have always clung
to my memory. As a rule I did not
like any reading beyond my school
books. The daily lessons had to be
done, because I did not want to be
taken to task by my teacher, nor to
deceive him. Therefore, I would do
the lessons, but often without my
mind in them. Thus when even the
lessons could not be done properly,
there was of course no question of
any extra reading. But somehow
my eyes fell on a book purchased
by my father. It was Shravana*
Pitribhakti Nataka (a play about
Shravana’s devotion to his parents).
I read it with intense interest.
There came to our place about
the same time wandering showmen.
One of the pictures I was
shown was of Shravana carrying,
by means of slings fitted for his
shoulders, his blind parents on a
pilgrimage. The book and the
picture left a permanent impression
on my mind. “Here is an
example for you to copy,” I said
to myself.
Just about this time, I had secured
my father’s permission to
see a play performed by a certain
dramatic company. This play –
* Shravana, a young ascetic, was extremely devoted to his blind parents whom he
carried in a hammock for a pilgrimage. On his way he was accidentally shot dead by
Rama's father, King Dasharatha.

Harishchandra+ – captured my
heart. I could never be tired of seeing
it. But how often should I be
permitted to go? I kept thinking
about it all the time and I must
have acted Harishchandra to myself
times without number. “Why
should not all be truthful like
Harishchandra ?” was the question
I asked myself day and night. To
follow truth and to go through all
the ordeals Harishchandra went
through was the one ideal it inspired
in me. I literally believed in
the story of Harishchandra. The
thought of it all often made me
weep.
I was not regarded as a dunce at
the high school. I always enjoyed
the affection of my teachers. Certificates
of progress and character
used to be sent to the parents every
year. I never had a bad certificate.
In fact I even won prizes after
I passed out of the second standard.
In the fifth and sixth I obtained
scholarships of rupees four
and ten respectively, an achievement
for which I have to thank
good luck more than my merit. For
the scholarships were not open to
all, but reserved for the best boys
amongst those coming from the
Sorath Division of Kathiawad. And
in those days there could not have
been many boys from Sorath in a
class of forty to fifty.
My own recollection is that I
had not any high regard for my
ability. I used to be astonished
whenever I won prizes and scholarships.
But I very jealously
guarded my character. The least
little fault drew tears from my
eyes. When I merited, or seemed
to the teacher to merit, a rebuke, it
was unbearable for me. I remember
having once received a beating.
I did not so much mind the punishment,
as the fact that it was
considered my deserts. I wept piteously.
That was when I was in the
first or second standard. There was
another such incident during the
time when I was in the seventh
standard. Dorabji Edulji Gimi was
the headmaster then. He was popular
among boys, as he was a disciplinarian,
a man of method and a
good teacher. He had made gymnastics
and cricket compulsory for
boys of the upper standards. I disliked
both. I never took part in any
exercise, cricket or football, before
+ Harishchandra, according to Hindu epics, was a king. He was famous for his
liberality, and unflinching adherence to truth. The celebrated sage Vishwamitra decided
to test the king and subjected him to very severe tests including compulsion to put his
own wife to death as a witch ! The king, however, stood the test with great courage and
truthfulness.
5
they were made compulsory. My
shyness was one of the reasons for
this aloofness, which I now see
was wrong. I then had the false
notion that gymnastics had nothing
to do with education.
I may mention, however, that I
was none the worse for keeping
away from exercise. That was because
I had read in books about
the benefits of long walks in the
open air, and having liked the advice,
I had formed a habit of taking
walks, which has still remained
with me. These walks gave me a
fairly hardy constitution.
The reason of my dislike for
gymnastics was my keen desire to
serve as nurse to my father. As
soon as the school closed, I would
hurry home and begin serving him.
Compulsory exercise came directly
in the way of this service. I requested
Mr. Gimi to exempt me
from gymnastics so that I might be
free to serve my father. But he
would not listen to me. Now it so
happened that one Saturday, when
we had school in the morning, I
had to go from home to the school
for gymnastics at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon. I had no watch, and the
clouds deceived me. Before I
reached the school the boys had all
left. The next day Mr. Gimi, examining
the roll, found me marked
absent. Being asked the reason for
absence, I told him what had happened.
He refused to believe me
and ordered me to pay a fine of
one or two annas (I cannot now
recall how much).
I was convicted of lying ! That
deeply pained me. How was I to
prove my innocence ? There was
no way. I cried in deep anguish. I
saw that a man of truth must also
be a man of care. This was the
first and last instance of my carelessness
in school. I have a faint
recollection that I finally succeeded
in getting the fine refunded. The
exemption from exercise was of
course obtained, as my father
wrote himself to the headmaster
saying that he wanted me at home
after school.
But though I was none the
worse for having neglected exercise,
I am still paying the penalty
of another neglect. I do not know
whence I got the notion that good
handwriting was not a necessary
part of education, but I retained it
until I went to England. Bad handwriting
should be regarded as a
sign of an imperfect education. I
tried later to improve mine, but it
was too late. I could never repair
the neglect of my youth.
Two more incidents of my
school days are worth recording. I
had lost one year because of my
marriage, and the teacher wanted
6
me to make good the loss by skipping
the class – a privilege usually
allowed to hard-working boys. I
therefore had only six months in
the third standard and was promoted
to the fourth after the examinations
which are followed by
the summer vacation. Most subjects
were taught in English from
the fourth standard. I found it very
hard. Geometry was a new subject
in which I was not particularly
strong, and the English medium
made it still more difficult for me.
The teacher taught the subject very
well but I could not follow him.
Often I would lose heart and think
of going back to the third standard,
feeling that the packing of two
years’ studies into a single year
was too much. But this would discredit
not only me, but also the
teacher; because, counting on my
ability, he had recommended my
promotion. So the fear of the
double discredit kept me at my
post. When, however, with much
effort I reached the thirteenth
proposition of Euclid, the utter
simplicity of the subject became
clear to me. A subject which only
required a pure and simple use of
one’s reasoning powers could not
be difficult. Ever since that time
geometry has been both easy and
interesting for me.
Sanskrit, however, proved a
harder task. In geometry there was
nothing to memorize, whereas in
Sanskrit, I thought, everything had
to be learnt by heart. This subject
also began from the fourth standard.
As soon as I entered the
sixth I became disheartened. The
teacher was a hard task-master,
anxious, as I thought, to force the
boys. There was a sort of rivalry
going on between the Sanskrit and
the Persian teachers. The Persian
teacher was lenient. The boys used
to talk among themselves that Persian
was very easy and the Persian
teacher very good and considerate
to the students. The ‘easiness’
tempted me and one day I sat in
the Persian class. the Sanskrit
teacher was grieved. He called me
to his side and said : “How can
you forget that you are the son of a
Vaishnava father ? Won't you learn
the language of your own religion
? If you have any difficulty,
why not come to me ? I want to
teach you students Sanskrit to the
best of my ability. As you proceed
further, you will find in it things of
great interest. You should not lose
heart. Come and sit again in the
Sanskrit class.”
This kindness put me to shame.
I could not disregard my teacher’s
affection. If I had not acquired the
little Sanskrit that I learnt then, I
should have found it difficult to
7
take any interest in our sacred
books. In fact I am sorry now that
I was not able to acquire a more
thorough knowledge of the language,
because I have since realized
that every Hindu boy and girl
should possess sound Sanskrit
learning.
3. MARRIAGE
It is my painful duty to have to
record here my marriage at the age
of thirteen. As I see the youngsters
of the same age about me who are
under my care, and think of my
own marriage, I am inclined to
pity myself and to congratulate
them on having escaped my lot. I
can see no moral argument in support
of such early marriage.
I do not think it meant to me
anything more than good clothes to
wear, drum beating, marriage processions,
rich dinners and a strange
girl to play with. We gradually began
to know each other, and to
speak freely together. We were the
same age. But I took no time in
assuming the authority of a husband.
I would not allow my wife to go
anywhere without my permission.
And Kasturba was not the girl to
put up with any such thing. She
made it a point to go out whenever
and wherever she liked. More restraint
on my part resulted in more
liberty being taken by her and in
my getting more and more angry.
Refusal to speak to one another
thus became the order of the day
with us, married children. I think it
was quite innocent of Kasturba not
to have bothered about my restrictions.
How could an innocent girl
put up with any restraint on going
to the temple or on going on visits
to friends? If I had the right to
restrict her, had not she also a
similar right? All this is clear to
me today. But at that time I had to
make good my authority as a husband
!
Let not the reader think, however,
that ours was a life of constant
quarrels. For my severities
were all based on love. I wanted to
make my wife an ideal wife. My
ambition was to make her live a
pure life, learn what I learnt, and
identify her life and thought with
mine.
I do not think Kasturba had any
such desire. She did not know to
read or write. By nature she was
simple, independent, persevering
and, with me at least, shy. She was
not impatient of her ignorance and
I do not recollect my studies having
ever made her want to go in
for studies herself.

4. A TRAGIC FRIENDSHIP
Amongst my few friends at the
high school I had, at different
times, two who might be called intimate.
One of these friendships
did not last long, though I never
gave up my friend. He gave me
up, because I made friends with
the other. This latter friendship I
regard as a tragedy in my life. It
lasted long. I formed it in the spirit
of a reformer.
This companion was originally
my elder brother’s friend. They
were classmates. I knew his weaknesses,
but I regarded him as a
faithful friend. My mother, my eldest
brother, and my wife warned
me that I was in bad company. I
was too proud to heed my wife’s
warning. But I dared not go
against the opinion of my mother
and my eldest brother. Nevertheless
I pleaded with them saying, “I
know he has the weakness you attribute
to him but you do not know
his virtues. He cannot lead me
astray, as my association with him
is meant to reform him. For I am
sure that if he reforms his ways, he
will be a splendid man. I beg you
not to be anxious on my account.”
I do not think this satisfied
them, but they accepted my explanation
and let me go my way.
A wave of ‘reform’ was sweeping
over Rajkot at the time when I
first came across this friend. He
informed me that many of our
teachers were secretly taking meat
and wine. He also named many
well-known people of Rajkot as
belonging to the same company.
There were also, I was told, some
highschool boys among them.
I was surprised and pained. I
asked my friend the reason and he
explained it thus: “We are a weak
people because we do not eat
meat. The English are able to rule
over us, because they are meat-eaters.
You know how hardy I am,
and how great a runner too. It is
With a friend because I am a meat-eater. Meat9
eaters do not have boils, and even
if they sometimes happen to have
any, these heal quickly. Our teachers
and other distinguished people
who eat meat are no fools. They
know its virtues. You should do
likewise. There is nothing like trying.
Try, and see what strength it
gives.”
All these pleas on behalf of
meat-eating were not made at a
single sitting. They represent the
substance of a long and elaborate
argument which my friend was trying
to impress upon me from time
to time. My elder brother had already
fallen. He therefore supported
my friend’s argument. I certainly
looked feeble-bodied by the
side of my brother and this friend.
They were both hardier, physically
stronger, and more daring. This
friend’s exploits cast a spell over
me. He could run long distances
and extraordinarily fast. He was an
adept in high and long jumping.
He could put up with any amount
of physical punishment. He would
often display his exploits to me
and, as one is always dazzled
when he sees in others the qualities
that he lacks himself, I was
dazzled by this friend’s exploits.
This was followed by a strong desire
to be like him. I could hardly
jump or run. Why should not I
also be as strong as he ?
Moreover, I was a coward. I
used to be afraid of thieves, ghosts
and serpents. I did not dare to stir
out of doors at night. Darkness
was a terror to me. It was almost
impossible for me to sleep in the
dark, as I would imagine ghosts
coming from one direction, thieves
from another and serpents from a
third. I could not therefore bear to
sleep without a light in the room.
My friend knew all these weaknesses
of mine. He would tell me
that he could hold in his hand live
serpents, could defy thieves and
did not believe in ghosts.
All these had its due effect on
me. I was beaten. It began to grow
on me that meat-eating was good,
that it would make me strong and
daring, and that, if the whole country
took to meat-eating, the English
could be overcome.
A day was thereupon fixed for
beginning the experiment. It had to
be done in secret as my parents
were orthodox Vaishnavas, and I
was extremely devoted to them. I
cannot say that I did not know
then that I should have to deceive
my parents if I began eating meat.
But my mind was bent on the ‘reform’.
It was not a question of
having something tasty to eat. I did
not know that it had a particularly
good taste. I wished to be strong
and daring and wanted my coun10
trymen also to be such. The zeal
for the ‘reform’ blinded me. And
having ensured secrecy, I persuaded
myself that mere hiding the
deed from parents was no departure
from truth.
So the day came. We went in
search of a lonely spot by the
river, and there I saw, for the first
time in my life, meat. There was
baker's bread also. I did not like
either. The goat's meat was as
tough as leather. I simply could not
eat it. I was sick and had to leave
off eating.
I had a very bad night afterwards.
A horrible dream haunted
me. Every time I dropped off to
sleep it would seem as though a
live goat were crying inside me,
and I would jump up sorry for
what I had done. But then I would
remind myself that meat-eating
was a duty and so become more
cheerful.
My friend was not a man to
give in easily. He now began to
cook various delicacies with meat.
And for dining, no longer was the
quiet spot on the river chosen, but
a State house, with its dining hall
and tables and chairs, about which
my friend had made arrangements
with the chief cook there.
Gradually I got over my dislike
for bread, gave up my pity for the
goats, and began to enjoy meatdishes,
if not meat itself. This
went on for about a year. But not
more than half a dozen meat-feasts
were enjoyed in all. I had no
money to pay for this ‘reform’. My
friend had therefore always to find
the money. I had no knowledge
where he found it. But find it he
did, because he was bent on turning
me into a meat-eater. But even
his means must have been limited,
and hence these feasts had necessarily
to be few and far between.
Whenever I had occasion to indulge
in these secret feasts, eating
at home was impossible. My
mother would naturally ask me to
come and take my food and want
to know the reason why I did not
wish to eat. I would say to her, “I
have no appetite today; there is
something wrong with my digestion.”
I knew I was lying, and lying
to my mother. I also knew that,
if my mother and father came to
know of my having become a
meat-eater, they would be deeply
shocked. This knowledge was
making me feel uneasy.
Therefore I said to myself :
“Though it is essential to eat meat,
and also essential to take up food
‘reform’ in the country, yet deceiving
and lying to one’s father and
mother is worse than not eating
meat. In their lifetime, therefore,
meat-eating must be given up.
11
When they are no more and I have
found my freedom, I will eat meat
openly, but until that moment arrives
I will keep away from it.”
This decision I told to my
friend, and I have never since gone
back to meat.
5. STEALING
I have still to relate some of my
failings during this meat-eating period
and also previous to it, which
date from before my marriage or
soon after.
A relative and I became fond of
smoking. Not that we saw any
good in smoking, or liked the
smell of a cigarette. We simply
imagined a sort of pleasure in
sending out clouds of smoke from
our mouths. My uncle had the
habit, and we should copy his example.
But we had no money. So
we began stealing stumps of cigarettes
thrown away by my uncle.
The stumps, however, were not
always available, and could not
give out much smoke either. So we
began to steal coppers from the
servant’s pocket-money in order to
purchase Indian cigarettes. But the
question was where to keep them.
We could not of course smoke in
the presence of elders. We managed
somehow for a few weeks on
these stolen coppers. In the meantime
we heard that the stalks of a
certain plant could be smoked like
cigarettes. We got them and began
this kind of smoking.
But we were far from being satisfied
with such things as these.
Our want of independence began
to be painful. It was unbearable
that we should be unable to do
anything without the elders’ permission.
At last, in sheer disgust,
we decided to commit suicide !
But how were we to do it? From
where were we to get the poison?
We heard that dhatura seeds were
an effective poison. Off we went to
the jungle in search of these seeds
and got them. Evening was thought
to be the auspicious hour. We went
to Kedarji Mandir, put ghee in the
temple-lamp, had the darshan and
then looked for a lonely corner. But
our courage failed us. Supposing we
were not at once killed ? And what
was the good of killing ourselves ?
Why not rather put up with the lack
of independence ? But we swallowed
two or three seeds nevertheless.
We dared not take more. Both
of us did not like to die, and decided
to go to Ramji Mandir to calm ourselves,
and to dismiss the thought of
suicide.
12
I realized that it was not easy to
commit suicide.
The thought of suicide ultimately
resulted in both of us bidding
goodbye to the habit of smoking
and of stealing the servant’s
coppers for the purpose.
Ever since I have grown up, I
have never desired to smoke and
have always regarded the habit of
smoking as barbarous, dirty and
harmful. I have never understood
why there is such a desire for
smoking throughout the world. I
cannot bear to travel in a compartment
full of people smoking. I become
choked.
But much more serious than this
theft was the one I was guilty of a
little later. I stole the coppers when
I was twelve or thirteen, possibly
less. The other theft was committed
when I was fifteen. In this case
I stole a bit of gold out of my
meat-eating brother’s armlet. This
brother had run into a debt of
about twenty-five rupees. He had
on his arm an armlet of solid gold.
It was not difficult to clip a bit out
of it.
Well, it was done, and the debt
cleared. But this became more than
I could bear. I resolved never to
steal again. I also made up my
mind to confess it to my father.
But I did not dare to speak. Not
that I was afraid of my father beating
me. No. I do not recall his ever
having beaten any of us. I was
afraid of the pain that I should
cause him. But I felt that the risk
should be taken; that there could
not be cleansing without a clean
confession.
I decided at last to write out the
confession to submit it to my father,
and ask his forgiveness. I
wrote it on a slip of paper and
handed it to him myself. In this
note not only did I confess my
guilt, but I asked adequate punishment
for it, and closed with a request
to him not to punish himself
for my offence. I also pledged myself
never to steal in future.
I was trembling as I handed the
confession to my father. He was
then confined to bed. His bed was
a plain wooden plank. I handed
him the note and sat opposite the
plank.
He read it through, and tears
trickled down his cheeks, wetting
the paper. For a moment he closed
his eyes in thought and then tore
up the note. He had sat up to read
it. He again lay down. I also cried.
I could see my father’s agony. If I
were a painter I could draw a picture
of the whole scene today. It is
still so vivid in my mind.
Those tears of love cleansed my
heart, and washed my sin away.
Only he who has experienced such
13
love can know what it is.
This sort of forgiveness was not
natural to my father. I had thought
that he would be angry, say hard
things, and strike his forehead. But
he was so wonderfully peaceful,
and I believe this was due to my
clean confession. A clean confession,
combined with a promise
never to commit the sin again,
when offered before one who has
the right to receive it, is the purest
type of repentance. I know that my
confession made my father feel absolutely
safe about me, and increased
greatly his affection for
me.
6. MY FATHER’S ILLNESS AND DEATH
The time of which I am now
speaking is my sixteenth year. My
father, as we have seen, was bedridden.
My mother, an old servant
of the house, and I were attending
on him. I had the duties of a nurse,
which mainly consisted in dressing
the wound, and giving my father
his medicine. Every night I massaged
his legs and retired only
when he asked me to do so or after
he had fallen asleep. I loved to
do this service. I do not remember
ever having neglected it. All the
time at my disposal, after the performance
of the daily duties, was
divided between school and attending
on my father. I would only go
out for an evening walk either
when he permitted me or when he
was feeling well.
The dreadful night came. It was
10-30 or 11 p.m. I was giving the
massage. My uncle offered to relieve
me. I was glad and went
straight to bed. In five or six minutes,
however, the servant knocked
at the door. I started with alarm.
“Get up,” he said. “Father is very
ill.” I knew of course that he was
very ill, and so I guessed what
Father Karamchand ‘very ill’ meant at that moment. I
14
sprang out of bed.
“What is the matter ? Do tell
me !”
“Father is no more.”
So all was over! I felt very unhappy
that I was not near my father
when he died.
7. GLIMPSES OF RELIGION
I have said before that there was
in me a fear of ghosts and spirits.
Rambha, my nurse, suggested, as a
remedy for this fear, the repetition
of Ramanama or name of God. I
had more faith in her than in her
remedy, and so at a very early age
began repeating Ramanama to cure
my fear of ghosts and spirits. This
was of course short-lived, but the
good seed sown in childhood was
not sown in vain. I think it is due
to the seed sown by that good
woman Rambha that today
Ramanama is a never failing remedy
for me.
During part of his illness my father
was in Porbandar. There every
evening he used to listen to the
Ramayana. The reader was a great
devotee of Rama. He had a good
voice. He would sing the verses
and explain them, losing himself in
the story and carrying his listeners
along with him. I must have been
thirteen at that time, but I quite
remember being quite taken up by
his reading. That laid the foundation
of my deep devotion to the
Ramayana. Today I regard the
Ramayana of Tulsidas as the greatest
book in all religious literature.
In Rajkot I learnt to be friendly
to all branches of Hinduism and
sister religions. For my father and
mother would visit the Haveli as
also Shiva's and Rama's temples,
and would take or send us youngsters
there. Jain monks also would
pay frequent visits to my father,
and would even go out of their
way to accept food from us – non-
Jains. They would have talks with
my father on subjects religious and
worldly.
He had besides, Mussalman and
Parsi friends, who would talk to
him about their own faiths, and he
would listen to them always with
respect, and often with interest.
Being his nurse, I often had a
chance to be present at these talks.
These many things combined to
teach me toleration for all faiths.
Only Christianity was at the
time an exception. I developed a
sort of dislike for it. And for a
reason. In those days Christian
missionaries used to stand in a corner
near the high school and
15
preach against Hindus and their
gods. I could not endure this.
About the same time, I heard of a
well-known Hindu having been
converted to Christianity. It was
the talk of the town that when he
was baptized, he had to eat beef
and drink liquor, that he also had
to change his clothes, and that
from then on he began to go about
in European costume including a
hat. I also heard that the new convert
had already begun abusing the
religion of his ancestors, their customs
and their country. All these
things made me dislike Christianity.
But the fact that I had learnt to
be tolerant to other religions did
not mean that I had any living
faith in God. But one thing took
deep root in me – the conviction
that morality is the basis of things
and that truth is the substance of
all morality.
A Gujarati verse likewise
gripped my mind and heart. Its
teaching – return good for evil –
became my guiding principle. It
became such a passion with me
that I began numerous experiments
in it. Here are those (for me) wonderful
lines :
For a bowl of water give a goodly
meal;
For a kindly greeting bow thou down
with zeal;
For a simple penny pay thou back with
gold;
If thy life be rescued, life do not withhold.
Thus the words and actions of the wise
regard;
Every little service tenfold they reward.
But the truly noble know all men as
one
And return with gladness good for evil
done.
8. PREPARATION FOR ENGLAND
My elders wanted me to continue
my studies at college after
school. There was a college in
Bhavnagar as well as in Bombay,
and as the former was cheaper, I
decided to go there and join the
Samaldas College. I went, but
found everything very difficult. At
the end of the first term, I returned
home.
We had in Mavji Dave, who
was a shrewd and learned Brahman,
an old friend and adviser of
the family. He had kept up his
connection with the family even
after my father's death. He happened
to visit us during my holidays.
In conversation with my
mother and elder brother, he inquired
about my studies. Learning
16
that I was at Samaldas College, he
said: “The times are changed. And
none of you can expect to succeed
to your father’s gadi (official
work) without having had a proper
education. Now as this boy is still
pursuing his studies, you should all
look to him to keep the gadi. It
will take him four or five years to
get his B. A. degree, which will at
best qualify him for a sixty rupees’
post, not for a Diwanship. If like
my son he went in for law, it
would take him still longer, by
which time there would be a host
of lawyers aspiring for a Diwan's
post. I would far rather that you
sent him to England. Think of that
barrister who has just come back
from England. How stylishly he
lives ! He could get the Diwanship
for the asking. I would strongly
advise you to send Mohandas to
England this very year. Kevalram
has numerous friends in England.
He will give notes of introduction
to them, and Mohandas will have
an easy time of it there.”
Joshiji – that is how we used to
call old Mavji Dave – turned to
me and asked : “Would you not
rather go to England than study
here ?” Nothing could have been
more welcome to me. I was finding
my studies difficult. So I
jumped at the proposal and said
that the sooner I was sent the better.
My elder brother was greatly
troubled in his mind. How was he
to find the money to send me?
And was it proper to trust a young
man like me to go abroad alone?
My mother was very worried. She
did not like the idea of parting
with me. She had begun making
minute inquiries. Someone had
told her that young men got lost in
England. Someone else had said
that they took to meat; and yet another
that they could not live there
without liquor. “How about all
this ?” she asked me. I said : “Will
you not trust me? I shall not lie to
you. I promise that I shall not
touch any of those things. If there
were any such danger, would
Joshiji let me go ?”
“I can trust you,” she said. “But
how can I trust you in a distant
land? I am confused and know not
what to do. I will ask Becharji
Swami.”
Becharji Swami was originally a
Modh Bania, but had now become
a Jain monk. He too was a family
adviser like Joshiji. He came to
my help, and said : “I shall get the
boy solemnly to take the three
vows, and then he can be allowed
to go.” I vowed not to touch wine,
woman and meat. This done, my
mother gave her permission.
The high school had a send-off
in my honour. It was an uncom17
mon thing for a young man of
Rajkot to go to England. I had
written out a few words of thanks.
But I could scarcely read them out.
I remember how my head reeled
and how my whole frame shook as
I stood up to read them.
With my mother’s permission
and blessings, I set off happily for
Bombay, leaving my wife with a
baby of a few months. But on arrival
there friends told my brother
that the Indian Ocean was rough in
June and July, and as this was my
first voyage, I should not be allowed
to sail until November.
Meanwhile my caste-people
were agitated over my going
abroad. A general meeting of the
caste was called and I was summoned
to appear before it. I went.
How I suddenly managed to gather
up courage I do not know. Fearless,
and without the slightest hesitation,
I came before the meeting.
The Sheth – the headman of the
community – who was distantly related
to me and had been on very
good terms with my father, thus
spoke to me :
“In the opinion of the caste your
proposal to go to England is not
proper. Our religion forbids voyages
abroad. We have also heard that it is
not possible to live there and keep to
our religion. One is obliged to eat
and drink with Europeans !”
To which I replied : “I do not
think it is at all against our religion
to go to England. I intend going
there for further studies. And I
have already solemnly promised to
my mother to keep away from
three things you fear most. I am
sure the vow will keep me safe.”
“But we tell you,” replied the
Sheth, “that it is not possible to
keep our religion there. You know
my relations with your father and
you ought to listen to my advice.”
“I know those relations”, said I.
“And you are as an elder to me.
But I am helpless in this matter. I
cannot change my decision to go
to England. My father’s friend and
adviser who is a learned Brahman
sees no objection to my going to
England, and my mother and
brother have also given me their
permission.”
“But will you disregard the orders
of the caste ?”
“I am really helpless. I think the
caste should not interfere in the
matter.”
This made the Sheth very angry.
He swore at me. I sat unmoved. So
the Sheth ordered : “This boy shall
be treated as an outcaste from today.
Whoever helps him or goes to
see him off at dock shall be punishable
with a fine of one rupee
four annas.”
The order had no effect on me,
18
and I took my leave of the Sheth.
But I wondered how my brother
would take it. Fortunately he remained
firm and wrote to assure
me that I had his permission to go,
in spite of the Sheth's order.
A berth was reserved for me by
my friends in the same cabin as
that of Shri Tryambakrai
Mazmudar, the Junagadh Vakil.
They also asked him to help me.
He was an experienced man of
mature age and knew the world. I
was yet a youth of eighteen without
any experience of the world.
Shri Mazmudar told my friends not
to worry about me.
I sailed at last from Bombay on
the 4th of September.
9. ON BOARD THE SHIP
I was not used to talking English,
and except for Shri
Mazmudar all the other passengers
in the second saloon were English.
I could not speak to them. For I
could rarely follow their remarks
when they came up to speak to
me, and even when I understood I
could not reply. I had to frame every
sentence in my mind before I
could bring it out. I was innocent
of the use of knives and forks and
had not the boldness to inquire
what dishes on the menu were free
of meat. I therefore never took
meals at table but always had them
in my cabin, and they consisted
principally of sweets and fruits
which I had brought with me. Shri
Mazmudar had no difficulty, and
he mixed with everybody. He
would move about freely on deck,
while I hid myself in the cabin the
whole day, only going up on deck
when there were but few people.
Shri Mazmudar kept pleading with
me to associate with the passengers
and to talk with them freely.
He told me that lawyers should
have a long tongue, and related to
me his legal experience. He advised
me to take every possible
opportunity of talking English and
not to mind making mistakes
which were obviously unavoidable
with a foreign tongue. But nothing
could make me conquer my shyness.
An English passenger, wanting
to be nice to me, drew me into
conversation. He was older than I.
He asked me what I ate, what I
was, where I was going, why I was
shy, and so on. He also advised me
to come to table. He laughed at my
insistence on not eating meat, and
said in a friendly way when we
were in the Red Sea : “It is all
19
very well so far but you will have
to change your decision in the Bay
of Biscay. And it is so cold in England
that one cannot possibly live
there without meat.”
“But I have heard that people
can live there without eating
meat,” I said.
“Rest assured it is a lie,” said
he. “No one, to my knowledge,
lives there without being a meateater.
Don’t you see that I am not
asking you to take liquor, though I
do so? But I do think you should
eat meat, for you cannot live without
it.”
“I thank you for your kind advice,
but I have solemnly promised
to my mother not to touch meat,
and therefore I cannot think of taking
it. If it be found impossible to
get on without it, I will far rather
go back to India than eat meat in
order to remain there.”
We entered the Bay of Biscay,
but I did not begin to feel the need
either of meat or liquor. We
reached Southampton, as far as I
remember, on a Saturday. On the
boat I had worn a black suit, the
white flannel one, which my
friends had got me, having been
kept especially for wearing when I
landed. I had thought that white
clothes would suit me better when
I stepped ashore, and therefore, I
did so in white flannels. Those
were the last days of September,
and I found I was the only person
wearing such clothes. I left in
charge of an agent of Grindlay and
Co. all my luggage including the
keys, seeing that many others had
done the same and I thought I
must do like them.
Someone on board had advised
us to put up at the Victoria Hotel
in London. Shri Mazmudar and I
accordingly went there. The shame
of being the only person in white
clothes was already too much for
me. And when at the Hotel I was
told that I should not get my things
from Grindlay’s the next day, it being
a Sunday, I felt very bad.
Dr. Mehta to whom I had wired
from Southampton, called at about
eight o’clock the same evening. He
gave me a hearty greeting. He
smiled at my being in white flannels.
As we were talking, I casually
picked up his top-hat, and trying
to see how smooth it was,
passed my hand over it the wrong
way and disturbed the fur. Dr.
Mehta looked somewhat angrily at
what I was doing and stopped me.
But the mischief had been done.
The incident was a warning for the
future, and Dr. Mehta gave me my
first lesson in European etiquette.
“Do not touch other people’s
things,” he said. “Do not ask questions
as we usually do in India on
20
first acquaintance; do not talk
loudly; never address people as
‘sir’ whilst speaking to them as we
do in India; only servants and subordinates
address their masters that
way.'' And so on and so forth. He
also told me that it was very expensive
to live in a hotel and recommended
that I should live with
a private family.
Shri Mazmudar and I found the
hotel to be a trying affair. It was
also very expensive. There was,
however, a Sindhi fellow-passenger
from Malta who had become
friends with Shri Mazmudar, and
as he was not a stranger to London,
he offered to find rooms for
us. We agreed, and on Monday, as
soon as we got our baggage, we
paid up our bills and went to the
rooms rented for us by the Sindhi
friend. I remember my hotel bill
came to £ 3, an amount which
shocked me. And I had practically
starved in spite of this heavy bill!
For I could relish nothing. When I
did not like one thing, I asked for
another, but had to pay for both
just the same. The fact is that all
this while I had depended on the
foodstuffs which I had brought
with me from Bombay.
I was very uneasy even in the
new rooms. I would continually
think of my home and country, and
of my mother’s love. At night the
tears would stream down my
cheeks, and home memories of all
sorts made sleep out of the question.
It was impossible to share my
misery with anyone. And even if I
could have done so, where was the
use? I knew of nothing that would
soothe me. Everything was strange
– the people, their ways, and even
their dwellings. I was a complete
stranger to English etiquette and
continually had to be on my guard.
There was the additional inconvenience
of the vegetarian vow. Even
the dishes that I could eat were
tasteless. I thus found myself between
Scylla and Charybdis*. England
I could not bear, but to return
to India was not to be thought
of. Now that I had come, I must
finish the three years, said the inner
voice.
* Scylla is a monster, according to Greek legend, living on the Italian side of the
Straits of Messina, and opposite to it is Charybdis, a whirlpool. So the phrase means,
being faced with two equally unpleasant alternatives. - Ed.

PART II : IN ENGLAND AS STUDENT
10. IN LONDON
riod with –. I will take you there.”
I gratefully accepted the suggestion
and removed to the friend’s
rooms. He was all kindness and
attention. He treated me as his
own brother, initiated me into English
ways and manners, and accustomed
me to talking the language.
My food, however, became
a serious question. I could not relish
boiled vegetables cooked without
salt or spices. The landlady
was at a loss to know what to prepare
for me. We had oatmeal porridge
for breakfast, which was
fairly filling, but always I starved
at lunch and dinner. The friend
continually reasoned with me to
eat meat, but I always pleaded my
vow and then remained silent.
Both for luncheon and dinner we
had spinach and bread and jam
too. I was a good eater and had a
big appetite; but I was ashamed to
ask for more than two or three
slices of bread, as it did not seem
correct to do so. Added to this,
there was no milk either for lunch
or dinner. The friend once got disgusted
with this state of things,
and said : “Had you been my own
brother, I would have sent you
away. What is the value of a vow
Dr. Mehta went on Monday to
the Victoria Hotel expecting to
find me there. He discovered that
we had left, got our new address,
and met me at our rooms. Dr.
Mehta inspected my room and its
furniture and shook his head in
disapproval. “This place won’t
do,” he said. “We come to England
not so much for the purpose of
studies as for gaining experience
of English life and customs. And
for this you need to live with a
family. But before you do so, I
think you had better be for a pe-
In London, as a Bar Student
22
made before an illiterate mother
and in ignorance of conditions
here? It is no vow at all. It would
not be regarded as a vow in law. It
is pure superstition to stick to such
a promise. And I tell you this persistence
will not help you to gain
anything here. You confess to having
eaten and liked meat. You took
it where it was absolutely unnecessary,
and will not where it is quite
essential. What a pity !”
But I was unyielding.
Day in and day out the friend
would argue, but I had an eternal
no to face him with. The more he
argued, the firmer I became. Daily
I would pray for God’s protection
and get it. Not that I had any idea
of God. It was faith that was at
work – faith of which the seed had
been sown by the good nurse
Rambha.
I had not yet started upon regular
studies. In India I had never
read a newspaper. But here I succeeded
in cultivating a liking for
them by regular reading. This took
me hardly an hour. I therefore began
to wander about. I went out in
search of a vegetarian restaurant. I
hit on one in Farringdon Street.
The sight of it filled me with the
same joy that a child feels on getting
a thing after its own heart.
Before I entered I noticed books
for sale exhibited under a glass
window near the door. I saw
among them Salt’s Plea For Vegetarianism.
This I purchased for a
shilling and went straight to the
dining room. This was my first
hearty meal since my arrival in
England. God had come to my aid.
I read Salt’s book from cover to
cover and was very much impressed
by it. From the date of
reading this book, I may claim to
have become a vegetarian by
choice. I blessed the day on which
I had taken the vow before my
mother. The choice was now made
in favour of vegetarianism, the
spread of which henceforward became
my mission.
11. PLAYING THE ENGLISH GENTLEMAN
Meanwhile my friend had not
ceased to worry about me. He one
day invited me to go to the theatre.
Before the play we were to dine
together at the Holborn Restaurant.
The friend had planned to take me
to this restaurant evidently imagining
that modesty would prevent me
from asking any questions. And it
was a very big company of diners
in the midst of which my friend
and I sat sharing a table between
23
us. The first course was soup. I
wondered what it might be made
of, but did not dare ask the friend
about it. I therefore summoned the
waiter. My friend saw the movement
and sternly asked across the
table what was the matter. With
considerable hesitation I told him
that I wanted to inquire if the soup
was a vegetable soup. “You are too
clumsy for decent society,” he angrily
exclaimed. “If you cannot behave
yourself, you had better go.
Feed in some other restaurant and
await me outside.” This delighted
me. Out I went. There was a vegetarian
restaurant close by, but it
was closed. So I went without
food that night. I accompanied my
friend to the theatre, but he never
said a word about the scene I had
created. On my part of course
there was nothing to say.
That was the last friendly quarrel
we had. It did not affect our
relations in the least. I could see
and appreciate the love underlying
all my friend’s efforts, and my respect
for him was all the greater
on account of our differences in
thought and action.
But I decided that I should put
him at ease, that I should assure
him that I would be clumsy no
more, but try to become polished
and make up for my vegetarianism
by cultivating other accomplishments
which fitted one for polite
society. And for this purpose I undertook
the all too impossible task
of becoming an English gentleman.
The clothes after the Bombay
cut that I was wearing were, I
thought, unsuitable for English society,
and I got new ones at the
Army and Navy Stores. I also went
in for a chimney-pot hat costing
nineteen shillings – an excessive
price in those days. Not content
with this, I wasted ten pounds on
an evening suit made in Bond
Street, the centre of fashionable
life in London; and got my good
and noble-hearted brother to send
me a double watch chain of gold.
It was not correct to wear a readymade
tie and I learnt the art of
tying one for myself. While in India
the mirror had been a luxury
permitted on the days when the
family barber gave me a shave.
Here I wasted ten minutes every
day before a huge mirror, watching
myself arranging my tie and parting
my hair in the correct fashion.
My hair was by no means soft, and
every day it meant a regular
struggle with the brush to keep it
in position. Each time the hat was
put on and off, the hand would
automatically move towards the
head to adjust the hair, not to mention
the other civilized habit of the
hand every now and then doing the
24
same thing when sitting in polished
society.
As if all this were not enough to
make me look the thing, I directed
my attention to other details that
were supposed to go towards the
making of an English gentleman. I
was told it was necessary for me
to take lessons in dancing, French,
and elocution or speechmaking.
French was not only the language
of neighbouring France, but it was
a language understood all over Europe
where I had a desire to travel.
I decided to take dancing lessons
at a class and paid down £ 3 as
fees for a term. I must have taken
about six lessons in three weeks.
But it was beyond me to achieve
anything like rhythmic motion. I
could not follow the piano and
hence found it impossible to keep
time. What then was I to do? The
recluse in the fable kept a cat to
keep off the rats, and then a cow
to feed the cat with milk, and a
man to keep the cow and so on.
My ambitions also grew like the
family of the recluse. I thought I
should learn to play the violin in
order to cultivate an ear for Western
music. So I invested £ 3 in a
violin and something more in fees.
I sought a third teacher to give me
lessons in elocution and paid him
a preliminary fee of a guinea. He
recommended Bell’s Standard
Elocutionist as the textbook, which
I purchased. And I began with a
speech of Pitt’s.
But soon I began to ask myself
what the purpose of all this was.
I had not to spend a lifetime in
England, I said to myself. What
then was the use of learning elocution?
And how could dancing
make a gentleman of me? The violin
I could learn even in India. I
was a student and ought to go on
with my studies. I should qualify
myself to become a barrister. If my
character made a gentleman of me,
so much the better. Otherwise I
should give up the ambition.
These and similar thoughts possessed
me, and I expressed them in
a letter which I addressed to the
elocution teacher, requesting him
to excuse me from further lessons.
I had taken only two or three. I
wrote a similar letter to the dancing
teacher, and went personally to
the violin teacher with a request to
dispose of the violin for any price
it might fetch. She was rather
friendly to me, so I told her how I
had discovered that I was pursuing
a false idea. She encouraged me in
my decision to make a complete
change.
This infatuation must have lasted
about three months. Being particular
about dress persisted for years. But
henceforward I became a student.

12. CHANGES
Let no one imagine that my experiments
in dancing and the like
marked a stage of indulgence in
my life. The reader will have noticed
that even then I knew what I
was doing and my expenses were
carefully calculated.
As I kept strict watch over my
way of living, I could see that it
was necessary to economize. So I
decided to take rooms on my own
account, instead of living any
longer in a family, and also to remove
from place to place according
to the work I had to do, thus
gaining expereince at the same
time. The rooms were so selected
as to enable me to reach the place
of business on foot in half an hour,
and so save fares. Before this I had
always taken some kind of conveyance
whenever I went anywhere,
and had to find extra time for
walks. The new arrangement combined
walks and economy, as it
meant a saving of fares and gave
me walks of eight or ten miles a
day. It was mainly this habit of
long walks that kept me practically
free from illness throughout my
stay in England and gave me a
fairly strong body.
Thus I rented a suite of rooms;
one for a sitting room and another
for a bedroom. This was the second
stage. The third was yet to
come.
These changes saved me half the
expenses. But how was I to utilize
the time? I knew that Bar examinations
did not require much study,
and I therefore did not feel pressed
for time. My weak English was a
perpetual worry to me. I should, I
thought, not only be called to the
Bar, but have some literary degree
as well. I inquired about the Oxford
and Cambridge University
courses, consulted a few friends,
and found that, if I elected to go to
either of these places, that would
mean greater expense and a much
longer stay in England than I was
prepared for. A friend suggested
that, if I really wanted to have the
satisfaction of taking a difficult examination,
I should pass the London
Matriculation. It meant a good
deal of labour and much addition
to my stock of general knowledge,
without any extra expense worth
the name. I welcomed the suggestion.
But the syllabus frightened
me. Latin and a modern language
were compulsory ! How was I to
manage Latin? But the friend entered
a strong plea for it : “Latin is
very valuable to lawyers. Knowledge
of Latin is very useful in understanding
law-books. And one
26
paper in Roman Law is entirely in
Latin. Besides a knowledge of
Latin means greater command over
the English Language.” This appealed
to me and I decided to learn
Latin, no matter how difficult it
might be. French I had already begun,
so I thought that should be the
modern language. I joined a private
Matriculation class. Examinations
were held every six months and I
had only five months at my disposal.
It was an almost impossible
task for me. I converted myself
into a serious student. I framed my
own timetable to the minute; but
neither my intelligence nor
memory promised to enable me to
tackle Latin and French besides
other subjects within the given period.
The result was that I failed in
Latin. I was sorry but did not lose
heart. I had acquired a taste for
Latin; also I thought my French
would be all the better for another
trial and I would select a new subject
in the science group. Chemistry
which was my subject in science
had no attraction for want of
experiments, whereas it ought to
have been a deeply interesting
study. It was one of the compulsory
subjects in India and so I had selected
it for the London Matriculation.
This time, however, I chose
Heat and Light instead of Chemistry.
It was said to be easy and I
found it to be so.
With my preparation for another
trial, I made an effort to simplify
my life still further. I felt that my
way of living was still beyond the
modest means of my family. The
thought of my struggling brother,
who nobly responded to my regular
calls for monetary help, deeply
pained me. I saw that most of those
who were spending from eight to
fifteen pounds monthly had the advantage
of scholarships. I had before
me examples of much simpler
living. I came across a fair number
of poor students living more humbly
than I. One of them was staying
in the slums in a room at two
shillings a week and living on two
pence worth of cocoa and bread
per meal from Lockhart’s cheap
Cocoa Rooms. It was far from me
to think of copying him, but I felt I
could surely have one room instead
of two and cook some of my meals
at home. That would be a saving of
four to five pounds each month. I
also came across books on simple
living. I gave up the suite of rooms
and rented one instead, invested in
a stove, and began cooking my
break-fast at home. The process
scarcely took me more than twenty
minutes for there was only oatmeal
porridge to cook and water to boil
for cocoa. I had lunch out, and for
dinner bread and cocoa at home.
27
Thus I managed to live on a shilling
and three pence a day. This
was also a period of intensive
study. Plain living saved me plenty
of time and I passed my examination.
Let not the reader think that this
living made my life by any means
a dreary affair. On the contrary the
change suited me beautifully. It
was also more in keeping with the
means of my family. My life was
certainly more truthful and my soul
knew no bounds of joy.
As soon as, or even before, I
made alterations in my expenses
and my way of living, I began to
make changes in my diet. I stopped
taking the sweets and spices I had
got from home. The mind having
taken a different turn, the fondness
for spices wore away, and I now
relished the boiled spinach which
in Richmond tasted insipid, cooked
without spices. Many such experiments
taught me that taste depended
much on one’s attitude of
mind rather than on the tongue.
The economic consideration was
of course constantly before me.
There was in those days a body of
opinion which regarded tea and
coffee as harmful and favoured cocoa.
And as I was convinced that
one should eat only articles that
nourished the body, I gave up tea
and coffee as a rule and took cocoa
instead.
There were many minor experiments
going on along with the
main one : as for example, giving
up starchy foods at one time, living
on bread and fruit alone at another,
and once living on cheese, milk
and eggs. This last experiment is
worth noting. It lasted not even a
fortnight. The reformer who advocated
starchless food had spoken
highly of eggs and held that eggs
were not meat. It was apparent that
there was no injury done to living
creatures in taking eggs. So I took
eggs in spite of my vow. But the
lapse was momentary. I had no
business to put a new interpretation
on the vow. The interpretation of
my mother who administered the
vow was there for me. I knew that
her definition of meat included
eggs. And as soon as I saw the true
import of the vow I gave up eggs
and the experiment alike.
Full of a new convert’s zeal for
vegetarianism, I decided to start a
vegetarian club in my locality. The
club went well for a while, but
came to an end in the course of a
few months. For I left the locality,
according to my custom of moving
from place to place periodically.
But this brief and modest experience
gave me some little training
in organizing and conducting institutions.
28
13. SHYNESS MY SHIELD
I was elected to the Executive
Committee of the Vegetarian Society,
and made it a point to attend
every one of its meetings, but I
always felt tongue-tied. It was only
in South Africa that I got over this
shyness, though I never completely
overcame it. It was impossible for
me to speak without preparation. I
hesitated whenever I had to face
strange audiences and avoided
making a speech whenever I could.
I must say that, beyond occasionally
exposing me to laughter,
my shyness has been no disadvantage
whatever. In fact I can see
that, on the contrary, it has been all
to my advantage. My hesitancy in
speech, which was once an annoyance,
is now a pleasure. Its greatest
benefit has been that it has
formed the habit of restraining my
thoughts. A man of few words will
rarely be thoughtless in his speech;
he will measure every word. My
shyness has been in reality my
shield. It has allowed me to grow.
It has helped me in my discovery
of truth.
14. ACQUAINTANCE WITH RELIGIONS
Towards the end of my second
year in England I came across two
Theosophists, brothers, and both
unmarried. They talked to me
about the Gita. They were reading
Sir Edwin Arnold’s translation –
The Song Celestial and they invited
me to read the original with
them. I felt ashamed, as I had read
the divine poem neither in Sanskrit
nor in Gujarati. I had to tell them
that I had not read the Gita, but
that I would gladly read it with
them, and that though my knowledge
of Sanskrit was meagre, still I
hoped to be able to understand the
original to the extent of telling
where the translation failed to
bring out the meaning. I began
reading the Gita with them. The
verses in the second chapter
If one,
Ponders on subjects of the sense, there
springs
Attraction; from attraction grows desire,
Desire flames to fierce passion, passion
breeds
Recklessness; then the memory – all
betrayed–
Lets noble purpose go, and saps the
mind,
Till purpose, mind, and man are all
undone.
29
made a deep impression on my
mind, and they still ring in my
ears. The book struck me as one of
priceless worth. The impression
has ever since been growing on me
with the result that I regard it today
as the best book for the
knowledge of Truth. It has afforded
me invaluable help in my
moments of gloom.
The brothers also recommended
The Light of Asia* by Sir Advin
Arnold, whom I knew till then as
the author only of The Song Celestial,
and I read it with even greater
interest than I did the
Bhagavadgita. Once I had begun it
I could not leave off. I recall having
read, at the brothers' instance,
Madame Blavatsky's Key to Theosophy.
This book stimulated in
me the desire to read books on
Hinduism, and made me give up
the idea taught by missionaries that
Hinduism was full of superstition.
About the same time I met a
good Christian from Manchester in
a vegetarian boarding house. He
talked to me about Christianity. I
narrated to him my Rajkot recollections.
He was pained to hear
them. He said, “I am a vegetarian.
I do not drink. Many Christians are
meat-eaters and drink, no doubt;
but neither meat-eating nor drinking
is enjoined by Scripture. Do
please read The Bible.”+ I accepted
his advice, and he got me a copy. I
began reading it, but I could not
possibly read through the Old Testament.
But the New Testament produced
a different impression, especially
the Sermon on the Mount*
which went straight to my heart. I
compared it with the Gita. The
verses, “But I say unto you, that ye
resist not evil; but whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn
to him the other also. And if any
man take away thy coat let him
have thy cloak too.” delighted me
beyond measure and put me in
mind of Shamal Bhatt’s “For a
bowl of water, give a goodly meal”
etc. My young mind tried to unify
the teaching of the Gita, the Light
of Asia and the Sermon on the
*Given in the form of a poem the message of Lord Buddha. – Ed.
+ The Scripture of the Christians. It is in two parts – firstly, the Old Testament,
containing several books relating to the period prior to Jesus Christ and secondly, the
New Testament, containing books after the time of Jesus Christ. The first four books of
the New Testament are called the Gospels and contain the story and teachings of
Jesus. –Ed.
*Jesus’s teachings delivered on a mountain side. See Matthew, Chapters V to
VII. – Ed.
30
Mount. That renunciation was the
highest form of religion appealed
to me greatly.
Beyond this acquaintance with
religion I could not go at the moment,
as reading for the examination
left me scarcely any time for
outside subjects. But I thought that
I should read more religious books
and acquaint myself with all the
principal religions.
PART III : IN INDIA AS BARRISTER
15. BACK IN INDIA
I passed my examinations, was
called to the Bar on the 10th of
June 1891, and enrolled in the
High Court on the 11th. On the
12th I sailed for home.
But notwithstanding my study
there was no end to my helplessness
and fear. I did not feel myself
qualified to practise law. I had read
the laws, but not learnt how to
practise law. Besides, I had learnt
nothing at all of Indian law. I had
not the slightest idea of Hindu and
Mahomedan Law. I had not even
learnt how to draft a plaint, and
felt completely helpless. I had serious
misgivings as to whether I
should be able even to earn a living
by the profession.
My elder brother had come to
meet me at the dock in Bombay. I
was pining to see my mother. My
brother had kept me ignorant of
her death, which took place whilst
I was still in England. He did not
want to give me the bad news in a
foreign land. The news, however,
was none the less a severe shock
to me. My grief was even greater
than over my father’s death. Most
of my cherished hopes were shattered.
But I remember that I did
not give myself up to any wild expression
of grief. I could even
check the tears, and took to life
just as though nothing had happened.
The storm in my caste over my
foreign voyage was still there. It
had divided the caste into two
camps, one of which immediately
re-admitted me, while the other
was bent on keeping me out. I
never tried to seek admission to
the section that had refused it. Nor
did I feel even mental resentment
against any of the headmen of that
section. Some of these regarded
me with dislike, but I scrupulously
avoided hurting their feelings. I
fully respected their regulations.
According to these, none of my re31
lations, including my father-in-law
and mother-in-law, and even my
sister and brother-in-law, could entertain
me; and I would not so
much as drink water at their
houses. They were prepared secretly
to lay aside the prohibition,
but I did not like to do a thing in
secret that I would not do in public.
The result of my scrupulous
conduct was that I never had occasion
to be troubled by the caste;
nay, I have experienced nothing
but affection and generosity from
the general body of the section that
still regards me as outside the
caste. They have even helped me
in my work, without ever expecting
me to do anything for the
caste. It is my conviction that all
these good things are due to my
non-resistance. Had I agitated for
being admitted to the caste, had I
attempted to divide it into more
camps, had I provoked the
castemen, they would surely have
retaliated and I would have found
myself in a whirlpool of agitation.
To start practice in Rajkot
would have meant sure ridicule. I
had hardly the knowledge of a
qualified vakil and yet I expected
to be paid ten times his fee! No
client would be fool enough to engage
me.
Friends advised me to go to
Bombay for some time in order to
gain experience of the High Court,
to study Indian law and to try and
get what cases I could. I took up
the suggestion and went. But it
was impossible for me to get along
in Bombay for more than four or
five months, there being no income
to square with the ever-increasing
expenditure. About this
time, I took up the case of one
Mamibai. It was a ‘small cause’.
“You will have to pay some commission
to the tout,”* I was told. I
emphatically declined. I gave no
commission but got Mamibai's
case all the same. It was an easy
case. I charged Rs. 30 for my fees.
The case was not likely to last
longer than a day.
This was my first appearance in
the Small Cause Court. I had to
cross-examine the plaintiff's witness.
I stood up, but my courage
failed. My head was reeling and I
felt as though the whole Court was
doing likewise. I could think of no
question to ask. The judge must
have laughed, and the vakils no
doubt enjoyed the sight. But I
could not see anything. I sat down
and told the agent that I could not
conduct the case, that he had better
*A man who obtains cases for lawyers. – Ed.
32
engage Shri Patel and have the fee
back from me. Shri Patel was duly
engaged for Rs. 51. To him, of
course, the case was child’s play.
I hastened from the Court, not
knowing whether my client won or
lost her case, but I was ashamed of
myself, and decided not to take up
any more cases untill I had courage
enough to conduct them. So I
thought I might take up a teacher's
job. My knowledge of English was
good enough and I should have
loved to teach English to Matriculation
boys in some school. In this
way I could have met part at least
of the expenses. I came across an
advertisement in the papers :
‘Wanted an English teacher to
teach one hour daily. Salary Rs.
75.’ The advertisement was from a
famous high school. I applied for
the post and was called for an interview.
I went there in high hopes,
but when the principal found that I
was not a graduate, he regretfully
refused me.
“But I have passed the London
Matriculation with Latin as my
second language.”
“True, but we want a graduate.”
There was no help for it. I was
very disappointed. My brother also
felt much worried. We both came
to the conclusion that it was no
use spending more time in
Bombay.
So I left Bombay and went to
Rajkot, where I set up my own office.
Here I got along moderately
well. Drafting applications and memorials
brought me, on an average,
Rs. 300 a month. For this work I
had to thank influence rather than
my own ability, for my brother’s
partner had a settled practice. All
applications etc. which were, really
or to his mind, of an important
character, he sent to big barristers.
To my lot fell the applications to
be drafted on behalf of his poor
clients.
16. THE FIRST SHOCK
My brother had been secretary
and adviser to the late Ranasaheb
of Porbandar before he was installed
on his gadi, and my brother
at this time suffered under the
charge of having given wrong advice
when in that office. The matter
had gone to the Political Agent
who was prejudiced against my
brother. Now I had known this officer
when in England, and he may
be said to have been fairly friendly
to me. My brother thought that I
should avail myself of the friend33
ship and putting in a good word on
his behalf, try to remove the prejudice
of the Political Agent. I did
not at all like this idea. I should
not, I thought, try to take advantage
of a trifling acquaintance in
England. If my brother was really
at fault, what use was my recommendation?
If he was innocent, he
should submit a petition in the
proper course and, confident of his
innocence, face the result. My
brother did not like this advice.
“You do not know Kathiawad,” he
said, “and you have yet to know
the world. Only influence counts
here. It is not proper for you, a
brother, to shirk your duty, when
you can clearly put in a good word
about me to an officer you know.”
I could not refuse him, so I went
to the officer much against my
will. I knew I had no right to approach
him and was fully conscious
that I was compromising
my self-respect. But I sought an
appointment and got it. I reminded
him of the old acquaintance, but I
immediately saw that Kathiawad
was different from England; that
an officer on leave was not the
same as an officer on duty. The
Political Agent owned the acquaintance,
but the reminder seemed to
stiffen him. “Surely you have not
come here to abuse that acquaintance,
have you ?” appeared to be
the meaning of that stiffness, and
seemed to be written on his brow.
Nevertheless I opened my case.
The sahib was impatient. “Your
brother is an intriguer. I want to
hear nothing more from you. I
have no time. If your brother has
anything to say, let him apply
through the proper channel.” The
answer was enough, was perhaps
deserved. But selfishness is blind. I
went on with my story. The sahib
got up and said : “You must go
now.”
“But please hear me out,” said
I. That made him more angry. He
called his peon and ordered him to
show me the door. I was still hesitating
when the peon came in,
placed his hands on my shoulders
and put me out of the room.
The sahib went away as also
the peon, and I departed fretting
and fuming. I at once wrote out
and sent over a note to this effect :
“You have insulted me. You have
assaulted me through your peon. If
you make no amends, I shall have
to proceed against you.”
Quick came the answer through
his sowar :
“You were rude to me. I asked
you to go and you would not. I
had no option but to order my
peon to show you the door. Even
after he asked you to leave the office,
you did not do so. He there34
fore had to use just enough force
to send you out. You are at liberty
to proceed as you wish.”
With this answer in my pocket,
I came home feeling ashamed, and
told my brother all that had happened.
He was grieved, but did not
know how to console me. He
spoke to his vakil friends to find
out how to proceed against the
sahib. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta happened
to be in Rajkot at this time,
having come down from Bombay
for some case. But how could a
junior barrister like me dare to see
him? So I sent him the papers of
my case, through the vakil who
had engaged him and begged for
his advice. “Tell Gandhi,” he said,
“such things are the common experience
of many vakils and barristers.
He is still fresh from England,
and hot-blooded. He does not
know British officers. If he would
earn something and have an easy
time here, let him tear up the note
and pocket the insult. He will gain
nothing by proceeding against the
sahib, and on the contrary will
very likely ruin himself. Tell him
he has yet to know life.”
The advice was as bitter as poison
to me, but I had to swallow it.
I pocketed the insult, but also profited
by it. “Never again shall I
place myself in such a false position,
never again shall I try to exploit
friendship in this way,” said I
to myself, and since then I have
never been guilty of a breach of
that determination. This shock
changed the course of my life.
I was no doubt at fault in having
gone to that officer. But his
impatience and overbearing anger
were out of all proportion to my
mistake. It did not justify expulsion.
Now most of my work would
naturally be in his court. I had no
desire to seek his favour. Indeed,
having once threatened to proceed
against him, I did not like to remain
silent.
Meanwhile I began to learn
something of the petty politics of
the country. Kathiawad, being
group of small states, naturally had
its rich crop of petty intrigues.
Princes were always at the mercy
of others and ready to lend their
ears to flatterers. Even the sahib’s
peon had to be coaxed, and the
sahib's shirastedar was more than
his master, as he was his eyes, his
ears and his interpreter. The
shirastedar's will was law, and his
income was always reputed to be
more than the sahib's. This may
have been an exaggeration, but he
certainly lived beyond his salary.
This atmosphere appeared to
me to be poisonous, and how to
remain in it was a problem for me.
I was thoroughly depressed and
35
my brother clearly saw it. We both
felt that, if I could secure some
job, I should be free from this atmosphere
of intrigue. But without
intrigue a ministership or judgeship
was out of the question. And
the quarrel with the sahib stood in
the way of my practice. I did not
know what to do.
In the meantime a Meman firm
from Porbandar wrote to my
brother making the following offer
: “We have business in South
Africa. Ours is a big firm, and we
have a big case there in the Court,
our claim being £ 40,000. It has
been going on for a long time. We
have engaged the services of the
best vakils and barristers. If you
sent your brother there, he would
be useful to us and also to himself.
He would be able to instruct our
lawyer better than ourselves. And
he would have the advantage of
seeing a new part of the world and
of making new acquaintances.”
“How long do you require my
services ?” I asked. “And what will
be the payment ?”
“Not more than a year. We will
pay you a first class return fare
and a sum of £ 105, all found.”
This was hardly going there as
a barrister. It was going as a servant
of the firm. But I wanted
somehow to leave India. There was
also the tempting opportunity of
seeing a new country, and of having
new experience. Also I could
send £ 105 to my brother and help
in the expenses of the household. I
closed with the offer without any
bargaining, and got ready to go to
South Africa.
PART IV : IN SOUTH AFRICA
17. ARRIVAL IN SOUTH AFRICA
The port of Natal is Durban also
known as Port Natal. Abdulla
Sheth was there to receive me. As
the ship arrived at the quay and I
watched the people coming on
board to meet their friends, I observed
that Indians were not held
in much respect. I could not fail to
notice a sort of snobbishness about
the manner in which those who
knew Abdulla Sheth behaved towards
him, and it stung me.
Abdulla Sheth had got used to it.
Those who looked at me did so
with a certain amount of curiosity.
My dress marked me out from
other Indians. I had a frock-coat
and a turban, in imitation of the
Bengal pugree.
On the second or third day of
36
me to several people and seated
me next to his attorney. The Magistrate
kept staring at me and finally
asked me to take off my turban.
This I refused to do and left
the court.
So here too there was fighting
in store for me.
I wrote to the press about the
incident and defended the wearing
of my turban in the court. The
question was very much discussed
in the papers, which described me
as an “unwelcome visitor”. Thus
the incident gave me an unexpected
advertisement in South Africa
within a few days of my arrival
there. My turban stayed with
me practically until the end of my
stay in South Africa.
my arrival he took me to see the
Durban court. There he introduced
Barrister Gandhi
18. TO PRETORIA
The firm received a letter from
their lawyers saying preparations
should be made for the case, and
that Abdulla Sheth should go to
Pretoria himself or send a representative.
Abdulla Sheth gave me
this letter to read, and asked me if
I would go to Pretoria. “I can only
say after I have understood the
case from you,” said I. “At present
I do not know what I have to do
there.” He thereupon asked his
clerks to explain the case to me.
On the seventh or eighth day after
my arrival, I left Durban. A
first class seat was booked for me.
It was usual there to pay five shillings
extra, if one needed a bedding.
Abdulla Sheth insisted that I
should book a bedding, but out of
obstinacy and pride and with a
view to saving five shillings, I declined.
Abdulla Sheth warned me.
“Look, now,” said he, “this is a
different country from India. Thank
God, we have enough and to spare.
Please do not stint yourself in anything
that you may need.”
37
I thanked him and asked him
not to be anxious.
The train reached Maritzburg,
the capital of Natal, at about 9
p.m. Beddings used to be provided
at this station. A railway servant
came and asked me if I wanted
one. “No,” said I, “I have one with
me.” He went away. But a passenger
came next, and looked me up
and down. He saw that I was a
‘coloured’ man. This disturbed
him. Out he went and came in
again with one or two officials.
They all kept quiet, when another
official came to me and said,
“Come along, you must go to the
van compartment.”
“But I have a first class ticket,”
said I.
“That doesn’t matter,” rejoined
the other. “I tell you, you must go
to the van compartment.”
“I tell you, I was permitted to
travel in this compartment at
Durban, and I insist on going on in
it.”
“No, you won’t,” said the official.
“You must leave this compartment,
or else I shall have to call a
police constable to push you out.”
“Yes, you may. I refuse to get
out voluntarily.”
The constable came. He took me
by the hand and pushed me out.
My luggage was also taken out. I
refused to go to the other compartment
and the train steamed away. I
went and sat in the waiting room,
keeping my handbag with me, and
leaving the other luggage where it
was. The railway authorities had
taken charge of it.
It was winter, and winter in the
higher regions of South Africa is
severely cold. Maritzburg being at
a high altitude, the cold was extremely
bitter. My overcoat was in
my luggage, but I did not dare to
ask for it lest I should be insulted
again, so I sat and shivered. There
was no light in the room. A passenger
came in at about midnight
and possibly wanted to talk to me.
But I was in no mood to talk.
I began to think of my duty.
Should I fight for my rights or go
back to India, or should I go on to
Pretoria without minding the insults,
and return to India after finishing
the case? It would be cowardice
to run back to India without
fulfilling my obligation. The hardship
to which I was subjected was
superficial – only a symptom of
the deep disease of colour prejudice.
I should try, if possible, to
root out the disease and suffer
hardships in the process. Redress
for wrongs I should seek only to
the extent that would be necessary
for the removal of the colour
prejudice.
So, I decided to take the next
38
available train to Pretoria.
The following morning I sent a
long telegram to the General Manager
of the Railway and also informed
Abdulla Sheth, who immediately
met the General Manager.
The Manager justified the conduct
of the railway authorities, but informed
him that he had already instructed
the Station Master to see
that I reached my destination.
Abdulla Sheth wired to the Indian
merchants in Maritzburg and to
friends in other places to meet me
and look after me. The merchants
came to see me at the station and
tried to comfort me by narrating
their own hardships and explaining
that what had happened to me was
nothing unusual. They also said
that Indians travelling first or second
class had to expect trouble
from railway officials and white
passengers. The day was thus spent
in listening to these tales of woe.
The evening train arrived. There
was a reserved berth for me. I now
purchased at Maritzburg the bedding
ticket I had refused to book at
Durban.
The train reached Charlestown
in the morning. There was no railway,
in those days, between
Charlestown and Johannesburg, but
only a stage-coach, which halted at
Standerton for the night en route. I
possessed a ticket for the coach,
which was not cancelled by the
break of the journey at Maritzburg
for a day; besides, Abdulla Sheth
had sent a wire to the coach agent
at Charlestown.
But the agent only needed a pretext
for putting me off, and so,
when he discovered me to be a
stranger, he said, “Your ticket is
cancelled.” I gave him the proper
reply. The reason at the back of his
mind was not want of accommodation,
but quite another. Passengers
had to be accommodated inside the
coach, but as I was regarded as a
‘coolie’ and looked a stranger, it
would be proper, thought the
‘leader’, as the white man in
charge of the coach was called, not
to seat me with the white passengers.
There were seats on either
side of the coachbox. The leader
sat on one of these as a rule. Today
he sat inside and gave me his
seat. I knew it was sheer injustice
and an insult, but I thought it better
to pocket it. I could not have
forced myself inside, and if I had
raised a protest, the coach would
have gone off without me. This
would have meant the loss of another
day, and Heaven only knows
what would have happened the
next day. So, much as I fretted
within myself, I prudently sat next
the coachman.
At about three o'clock the coach
39
reached Pardekoph. Now the
leader desired to sit where I was
seated, as he wanted to smoke and
possibly to have some fresh air. So
he took a piece of dirty sack-cloth
from the driver, spread it on the
footboard and, addressing me said,
“Sami, you sit on this, I want to sit
near the driver.” The insult was
more than I could bear. In fear and
trembling I said to him, “It was
you who seated me here, though I
should have been accommodated
inside. I put up with the insult.
Now that you want to sit outside
and smoke, you would have me sit
at your feet. I will not do so, but I
am prepared to sit inside.”
As I was struggling through
these sentences, the man came
down upon me and began heavily
to box my ears. He seized me by
the arm and tried to drag me
down. I clung to the brass rails of
the coachbox and was determined
to keep my hold even at the risk of
breaking my wristbones. The passengers
were witnessing the scene
– the man swearing at me, dragging
and beating me, and I remaining
still. He was strong, and I was
weak. Some of the passengers
were moved to pity and exclaimed:
“Man, let him alone. Don’t beat
him. He is not to blame. He is
right. If he can’t stay there, let him
come and sit with us.” “No fear,”
cried the man, but he seemed
somewhat ashamed and stopped
beating me. He let go my arm,
swore at me a little more, and asking
the Hottentot servant who was
sitting on the other side of the
coachbox to sit on the footboard,
took the seat so vacated.
The passengers took their seats
and, the whistle given, the coach
rattled away. My heart was beating
fast within my breast, and I was
wondering whether I should ever
reach my destination alive. The
man cast an angry look at me now
and then and, pointing his finger at
me, growled : “Take care, let me
once get to Standerton and I shall
show you what I do.” I sat speechless
and prayed to God to help me.
After dark we reached
Standerton and I heaved a sigh of
relief on seeing some Indian faces.
As soon as I got down, these
friends said : “We are here to receive
you and take you to Isa
Sheth’s shop. We have had a telegram
from Dada Abdulla.” I was
very glad, and we went to Sheth
Isa Haji Summar's shop.
I wanted to inform the agent of
the Coach Company of the whole
affair. So I wrote him a letter, narrating
everything that had happened,
and drawing his attention to
the threat this man had held out. I
also asked for an assurance that he
40
would accommodate me with the
other passengers inside the coach
when we started the next morning.
To which the agent replied to this
effect : “From Standerton we have
a bigger coach with different men
in charge. The man complained of
will not be there tomorrow, and
you will have a seat with the other
passengers.” This somewhat relieved
me. I had, of course, no intention
of proceeding against the
man who had assaulted me, and so
the chapter of the assault closed
there.
In the morning Isa Sheth’s man
took me to the coach. I got a good
seat and reached Johannesburg
quite safely that night.
Standerton is a small village and
Johannesburg a big city. Abdulla
Sheth had wired to Johannesburg
also and given me the name and
address of Muhammad Kasam
Kamruddin’s firm there. Their man
had come to receive me at the
stage, but neither did I see him nor
did he recognize me. So I decided
to go to a hotel. I knew the names
of several. Taking a cab I asked to
be driven to the Grand National
Hotel. I saw the Manager and
asked for a room. He looked at me
for a moment, and politely saying,
“I am very sorry, we are full up,”
bade me good-bye. So I asked the
cabman to drive to Muhammad
Kasam Kamruddin's shop. Here I
found Abdul Gani Sheth expecting
me, and he gave me a cordial
greeting. He had a hearty laugh
over the story of my experience at
the hotel. “How ever did you expect
to be admitted to a hotel?” he
said.
“Why not ?” I asked.
“You will come to know after
you have stayed here a few days,”
said he.
“Look now, you have to go to
Pretoria tomorrow. You will have
to travel third class. Conditions in
the Transvaal are worse than in
Natal. First and second class tickets
are never issued to Indians.”
I sent for the railway regulations
and read them. There was a loophole.
The language of the old
Transvaal enactments was not very
exact or precise; that of the railway
regulations was even less so.
I said to the Sheth : “I wish to
go first class, and if I cannot, I
shall prefer to take a cab to
Pretoria, a matter of only thirtyseven
miles.”
Sheth Abdul Gani drew my attention
to the extra time and
money this would mean, but
agreed to my proposal to travel
first, and accordingly we sent a
note to the station master. I mentioned
in my note that I was a barrister
and that I always travelled
41
first. I also stated in the letter that
I needed to reach Pretoria as early
as possible, that as there was no
time to await his reply I would receive
it in person at the station,
and that I should expect to get a
first class ticket. There was of
course a purpose behind asking for
the reply in person. I thought that,
if the station master gave a written
reply, he would certainly say “no”,
especially because he would have
his own notion of a “coolie” barrister.
I would therefore appear before
him in faultless English dress,
talk to him and possibly persuade
him to issue a first class ticket. So I
went to the station master in a frockcoat
and necktie, placed a sovereign
for my fare on the counter and asked
for a first class ticket.
“You sent me that note ?” he
asked.
“That is so. I shall be much
obliged if you will give me a
ticket. I must reach Pretoria today.”
He smiled and, moved to pity,
said: “I am not a Transvaaler. I am
a Hollander. I appreciate your feelings,
and you have my sympathy. I
do want to give you a ticket – on
one condition, however, that, if the
guard should ask you to shift to
the third class, you will not involve
me in the affair, by which I
mean that you should not proceed
against the railway company. I
wish you a safe journey. I can see
you are a gentleman.”
With these words he booked the
ticket. I thanked him and gave him
the necessary assurance.
Sheth Abdul Gani had come to
see me off at the station. The incident
gave him an agreeable surprise,
but he warned me saying : “I
shall be thankful if you reach
Pretoria all right. I am afraid the
guard will not leave you in peace
in the first class and even if he
does, the passengers will not.”
I took my seat in a first class
compartment and the train started.
At Germiston the guard came to
examine the tickets. He was angry
to find me there, and signalled to
me with his finger to go to the
third class. I showed him my first
class ticket. “That does not matter,”
said he, “remove to the third
class.”
There was only one English passenger
in the compartment. He
took the guard to task. “What do
you mean by troubling the gentleman
?” he said. “Don’t you see he
has a first class ticket? I do not
mind in the least his travelling
with me.” Addressing me, he said,
“You should make yourself comfortable
where you are.”
The guard muttered : “If you
want to travel with a coolie, what
do I care?” and went away.
At about eight o'clock in the
evening the train reached Pretoria.
42
19. FIRST DAY IN PRETORIA
Pretoria station in 1893 was
quite different from what it was in
1914. The lights were burning
dimly. The travellers were few. I
let all the other passengers go and
thought that, as soon as the ticket
collector was fairly free, I would
hand him my ticket and ask him if
he could direct me to some small
hotel or any other such place
where I might go; otherwise I
would spend the night at the station.
I must confess I shrank from
asking him even this, for I was
afraid of being insulted.
The station became clear of all
passengers. I gave my ticket to the
ticket collector and began my inquiries.
He replied to me courteously,
but I saw that he could not
be of any considerable help. But
an American Negro who was
standing near by broke into the
conversation.
“I see,” said he, “that you are an
utter stranger here, without any
friends. If you will come with me I
will take you to a small hotel, of
which the proprietor is an American
who is very well known to me.
I think he will accept you.”
I had my own doubts about the
offer, but I thanked him and accepted
his suggestion. He took me
to Johnston’s Family Hotel. He
drew Mr. Johnston aside to speak
to him, and the latter agreed to accommodate
me for the night, on
condition that I should have my
dinner served in my room.
“I assure you,” said he, “that I
have no colour prejudice. But I
have only European custom, and if
I allowed you to eat in the dining
room, my guests might be offended
and even go away.”
“Thank you,” said I, “even for
accommodating me for the night. I
am now more or less acquainted
with the conditions here, and I understand
your difficulty. I do not
mind your serving the dinner in
my room. I hope to be able to
make some other arrangement tomorrow.”
I was shown into a room where
I now sat waiting for the dinner
and thinking, as I was quite alone.
There were not many guests in the
hotel, and I had expected the
waiter to come very shortly with
the dinner. Instead Mr. Johnston
appeared. He said : “I was
ashamed of having asked you to
have your dinner here. So I spoke
to the other guests about you, and
asked them if they would mind
your having your dinner in the dining
room. They said they had no
objection, and that they did not
43
mind your staying here as long as
you liked. Please, therefore, come
to the dining room, if you will,
and stay here as long as you
wish.” I thanked him again, went
to the dining room and had a
hearty dinner.
Next morning I called on the attorney,
Mr. A. W. Baker. Abdulla
Sheth had given me some description
of him, so his cordial reception
did not surprise me. He received
me very warmly and made
kind inquiries. I explained all
about myself. Thereupon he said:
“We have no work for you here as
barrister, for we have engaged the
best lawyer. The case is a prolonged
and complicated one, so I
shall take your assistance only to
the extent of getting necessary information.
And of course, you will
make communication with my client
easy for me, as I shall now ask
for all the information I want from
him through you. That is certainly
an advantage. I have not yet found
rooms for you. I thought I had better
do so after having seen you.
There is a fearful amount of colour
prejudice here, and therefore it is
not easy to find lodging for such
as you. But I know a poor woman.
She is the wife of a baker. I think
she will take you and thus add to
her income at the same time.
Come, let us go to her place.”
So he took me to her house. He
spoke with her privately about me,
and she agreed to accept me as a
boarder at 35 shillings a week.
20. GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE INDIAN PROBLEM
My stay in Pretoria enabled me
to make a deep study of the social,
economic and political condition
of the Indians in the Transvaal and
the Orange Free State. I had no
idea that this study was to be of
invaluable service to me in the future.
It was provided under the
amended law that all Indians
should pay a poll tax of £ 3 as fee
for entry into the Transvaal. They
might not own land except in
places set apart for them, and in
practice even that was not to be
ownership. They had no vote. All
this was under the special law for
Asiatics, to whom the laws for the
coloured people were also applied.
Under these latter, Indians might
not walk on public footpaths, and
might not move out of doors after
9 p.m. without a permit. I often
went out at night for a walk with a
friend, Mr. Coates, and we rarely
got back home much before ten
44
o'clock. What if the police arrested
me? Mr. Coates was more concerned
about this than I. He had to
issue passes to his Negro servants.
But how could he give one to me?
Only a master might issue a permit
to a servant. If I had wanted one,
and even if Mr. Coates had been
ready to give it, he could not have
done so, for it would have been
fraud.
So Mr. Coates or some friend of
his took me to the State Attorney,
Dr. Krause. We turned out to be
barristers of the same Inn. The fact
that I needed a pass to enable me
to be out of doors after 9 p.m. was
too much for him. He expressed
sympathy for me. Instead of ordering
for me a pass, he gave me a
letter authorizing me to be out of
doors at all hours without police
interference. I always kept this letter
on me whenever I went out.
The fact that I never had to make
use of it was a mere accident.
The consequences of the regulation
regarding the use of footpaths
were rather serious for me. I always
went out for a walk through
President Street to an open plain.
President Kruger’s house was in
this street – a very modest building
without a garden and, not distinguishable
from other houses in its
neighbourhood.
Only the presence of a policeman
before the house indicated
that it belonged to some official. I
nearly always went along the footpath
past this patrol without the
slightest hitch or hindrance.
Now the man on duty used to be
changed from time to time. Once
one of these men, without giving
me the slightest warning, without
even asking me to leave the footpath,
pushed and kicked me into
the street. I was dismayed. Before
I could question him as to his
behaviour, Mr. Coates, who happened
to be passing the spot on
horseback, hailed me and said :
“Gandhi, I have seen everything.
I shall gladly be your witness in
court if you proceed against the
man. I am very sorry you have
been so rudely assaulted.”
“You need not be sorry,” I said.
“What does the poor man know?
All coloured people are the same
to him. He no doubt treats Negroes
just as he has treated me. I have
made it a rule not to go to court in
respect of any personal grievance.
So I do not intend to proceed
against him.”
“That is just like you,” said Mr.
Coates, “but do think it over again.
We must teach such men a lesson.”
He then spoke to the policeman
and scolded him. I could not
follow their talk as it was in
Dutch, the policeman being a Boer.
45
But he apologized to me, for
which there was no need. I had
already forgiven him.
But I never again went through
this street. There would be other
men coming in this man's place
and ignorant of the incident, they
would behave likewise. Why
should I unnecessarily court another
kick ? I therefore selected a
different walk.
I saw that South Africa was no
country for a self-respecting Indian,
and my mind became more
and more occupied with the question
as to how this state of things
might be improved. But my principal
duty for the moment was to
attend to the case of Dada
Abdulla.
21. THE CASE
I saw that the facts of Dada
Abdulla's case made it very strong
indeed, and that the law was
bound to be on his side. But I also
saw that the case, if it were persisted
in, would ruin both him and
his opponent, who were relatives
and both belonged to the same
city. No one knew how long the
case might go on. I felt that my
duty was to befriend both parties
and bring them together. I strained
every nerve to bring about a compromise
and succeeded.
Both were happy over the result,
and both rose in the public estimation.
My joy was boundless. I had
learnt the true practice of law. I
had learnt to find out the better
side of human nature and to enter
men’s hearts. I realized that the
true function of a lawyer was to
unite parties driven apart by a
quarrel. The lesson was so burnt
into me that a large part of my
time during the twenty years of my
practice as a lawyer was occupied
in bringing about private compromises
of hundreds of cases. I lost
nothing thereby – not even money,
certainly not my soul.
22. MAN PROPOSES, GOD DISPOSES
The case having been concluded,
I had no reason for staying
in Pretoria. So I went back to
Durban and began to make preparations
for my return home. But
Abdulla Sheth was not the man to
let me sail without a send-off. He
gave a farewell party in my honour
at Sydenham.
It was proposed to spend the
46
whole day there. Whilst I was
turning over the sheets of some of
the newspapers I found there, I
chanced to see a paragraph in a
corner of one of them under the
title ‘Indian Franchise’. It was with
reference to the Bill then before
the House of Legislature, which
sought to deprive the Indians of
their right to elect members of the
Natal Legislative Assembly. I was
ignorant of the Bill and so were
the rest of the guests who had
gathered there.
I inquired of Abdulla Sheth
about it. He said : “What can we
understand in these matters? We
can only understand things that affect
our trade.” But I was on the
point of returning home and hesitated
to express what was passing
through my mind in this matter. I
simply said to Abdulla Sheth :
“This Bill, if it passes into law,
will make our lot extremely difficult.
It strikes at the root of our
self-respect.”
The other guests were listening
to this conversation with attention.
One of them said: “Shall I tell you
what should be done? You cancel
your passage by this boat, stay
here a month longer, and we will
fight as you direct us.” All the others
supported him.
It was now impossible for me to
leave Natal. The Indian friends
surrounded me on all sides and
begged me to remain there permanently.
Thus I settled in Natal.
Continued agitation was essential
for making an impression on the
Secretary of State for the Colonies.
For this purpose it was thought
necessary to bring into being a permanent
organization. So I consulted
Sheth Abdulla and other
friends, and we all decided to have
a public organization of a permanent
character, and on the 22nd
May* the Natal Indian Congress
came into being.
*of 1894
23. THE £ 3 TAX
About the year 1860 the Europeans
in Natal, finding that there was
considerable scope for sugarcane
cultivation, felt themselves in need
of labour. Without outside labour
the cultivation of cane and the
manufacture of sugar were impossible,
as the Natal Zulus were not
suited to this form of work. The
Natal Government therefore corresponded
with the Indian Government,
and secured their permission
47
to recruit Indian labour. These recruits
were to sign an agreement or
indenture to work in Natal for five
years, and at the end of the term
they were to be at liberty to settle
there and to have full rights of
ownership of land. Those were the
inducements held out to them.
But the Indians gave more than
had been expected of them. They
grew large quantities of vegetables.
They introduced a number of Indian
varieties and made it possible
to grow the local varieties cheaper.
They also introduced the mango.
Nor did their enterprise stop at agriculture.
They entered trade. They
purchased land for building, and
many raised themselves from the
status of labourers to that of owners
of land and houses. Merchants
from India followed them and
settled there for trade.
The white traders were alarmed.
When they first welcomed the Indian
labourers, they did not know
their business skill. They might be
tolerated as independent agriculturists,
but their competition in trade
could not be allowed.
This sowed the seed of the antagonism
to Indians. Many other
factors contributed to its growth.
Through legislation this antagonism
found its expression in a bill
to impose a tax on the indentured
Indians.
We organized a fierce campaign
against this tax. Had the community
given up the struggle, had the
Congress abandoned the campaign
and submitted to the tax as inevitable,
the hated tax would have
continued to be levied from the indentured
Indians until this day, to
the eternal shame of the Indians in
South Africa and of the whole of
India.
By now I had been three years
in South Africa. I had got to know
the people and they had got to
know me. In 1896 I asked permission
to go home for six months,
for I saw that I was in for a long
stay there. I had established a
fairly good practice, and could see
that people felt the need of my
presence. So I made up my mind
to go home, fetch my wife and
children, and then return and settle
out there. I also saw that, if I went
home, I might be able to do there
some public work by educating
public opinion and creating more
interest in the Indians in South Africa.
48
PART V : VISIT TO INDIA
24. IN INDIA
I went straight to Rajkot without
halting at Bombay and began to
make preparations for writing a
pamphlet on the situation in South
Africa. The writing and publication
of the pamphlet took about a
month. It had a green cover and
came to be known afterwards as
the Green Pamphlet. In it I drew a
purposely subdued picture of the
condition of Indians in South Africa.
Ten thousand copies were
printed and sent to all the papers
and leaders of every party in India.
A summary of the article was
cabled by Reuter to England, and a
summary of that summary was
cabled to Natal by Reuter’s London
office. This cable was not
longer than three lines in print. It
was a brief, but exaggerated, edition
of the picture I had drawn of
the treatment accorded to the Indians
in Natal, and it was not in my
words. We shall see later on the
effect this had in Natal. In the
meanwhile every paper of note
commented at length on the question.
To get these pamphlets ready for
posting was no small matter. It
would have been expensive too, if
I had employed paid help for preparing
wrappers etc. But I hit upon
a much simpler plan. I gathered
together all the children in my locality
and asked them to volunteer
two or three hours’ labour of a
morning, when they had no school.
This they willingly agreed to do. I
promised to bless them, and give
them, as a reward, used postage
stamps which I had collected. They
got through the work in no time.
That was my first experiment of
having little children as volunteers.
Two of those little friends are my
co-workers today.
It was my intention to educate
public opinion in cities on this
question by organizing meetings,
and Bombay was the first city I
chose. After Bombay and Poona I
went to Madras, and from Madras
I proceeded to Calcutta. There I
received the following cable from
Durban: “Parliament opens January.
Return soon.”
So in the beginning of December
I set sail second time for South
Africa, now with my wife and two
sons and the only son of my widowed
sister. Another steamship
Naderi also sailed for Durban at
the same time. The agents of the
Company were Dada Abdulla and
49
Co. The total number of passengers
these boats carried must have
been about eight hundred, half of
whom where bound for the
Transvaal.
PART VI : BACK IN SOUTH AFRICA
25. STORMY ARRIVAL IN SOUTH AFRICA
The two ships cast anchor in the
port of Durban on or about the
18th of December. No passengers
are allowed to land at any of the
South African ports before being
subjected to a thorough medical
examination. If the ship has any
passenger suffering from contagious
disease, she has to undergo a
period of quarantine. As there had
been plague in Bombay when we
set sail, we feared that we might
have to go through a brief quarantine.
The doctor came and examined
us. He ordered a five days'
quarantine because, in his opinion,
plague germs took twenty-three
days at the most to develop. Our
ship was therefore ordered to be
put in quarantine until the twentythird
day of our sailing from
Bombay. But this quarantine order
had more than health reasons behind
it.
The white residents of Durban
had been agitating for our repatriation,
and the agitation was one of
the reasons for the order. Dada
Abdulla and Co. kept us regularly
informed about the daily happenings
in the town. The whites were
holding monster meetings every
day. On one side there was a handful
of poor Indians and a few of
their English friends, and on the
other were ranged the white men,
strong in arms, in numbers, in education
and in wealth. They had
also the backing of the State, for
the Natal Government openly
helped them.
We arranged all sorts of games
on the ships for the entertainment
of the passengers. I took part in
the merriment, but my heart was in
the combat that was going on in
Durban. For I was the real target.
There were two charges against
me :
1. that whilst in India I had indulged
in unmerited condemnation
of the Natal whites;
2. that with a view to swamping
Natal with Indians I had specially
brought the two shiploads of passengers
to settle there.
But I was absolutely innocent. I
had induced no one to go to Natal.
50
I did not know the passengers
when they embarked. And with the
exception of a couple of relatives,
I did not know the name and address
of even one of the hundreds
of passengers on board. Neither
had I said, whilst in India, a word
about the whites in Natal that I
had not already said in Natal itself.
And I had ample evidence in support
of all that I had said.
Thus the days dragged on their
weary length.
At the end of twenty-three days
the ships were permitted to enter
the harbour, and orders permitting
the passengers to land were
passed.
So the ships were brought into
the dock and the passengers began
to go ashore. But Mr. Escombe, a
member of the Cabinet, had sent
word to the captain that, as the
whites were highly enraged against
me and my life was in danger, my
family and I should be advised to
land at dusk, when the Port Superintendent,
Mr. Tatum, would escort
us home. The captain communicated
the message to me, and I
agreed to act accordingly. But
scarcely half an hour after this, Mr.
Laughton, a friend and advocate of
the Indian community in Durban,
came to the captain. He said : “I
would like to take Mr. Gandhi
with me, should he have no objection.
As the legal adviser of the
Agent Company I tell you that you
are not bound to carry out the message
you have received from Mr.
Escombe.” After this he came to
me and said somewhat to this effect
: “If you are not afraid, I suggest
that Mrs. Gandhi and the children
should drive to Mr.
Rustomji’s house, whilst you and I
follow them on foot. I do not at all
like the idea of your entering the
city like a thief in the night. I do
not think there is any fear of anyone
hurting you. Everything is
quiet now. The whites have all dispersed.
But in any case I am convinced
that you ought not to enter
the city stealthily.” I readily
agreed. My wife and children
drove safely to Mr. Rustomji’s
place. With the captain's permission
I went ashore with Mr.
Laughton. Mr. Rustomji’s house
was about two miles from the
dock.
As soon as we landed, some
youngsters recognized me and
shouted “Gandhi, Gandhi.” About
half a dozen men rushed to the
spot and joined in the shouting.
Mr. Laughton feared that the
crowd might swell and hailed a
rickshaw. I had never liked the
idea of being in a rickshaw. This
was to be my first experience. But
the youngsters would not let me
51
get into it. They frightened the
rickshaw boy out of his life, and
he took to his heels. As we went
ahead the crowd continued to
swell, until it became impossible
to proceed further. They first
caught hold of Mr. Laughton and
separated us. Then they pelted me
with stones, brickbats and rotten
eggs. Someone snatched away my
turban, whilst others began to beat
and kick me. I fainted and caught
hold of the front railings of a
house and stood there to get my
breath. But it was impossible.
They came upon me boxing and
beating. The wife of the Police Superintendent,
who knew me, happened
to be passing by. The brave
lady came up, opened her umbrella
though there was no sun then, and
stood between the crowd and me.
This checked the fury of the mob,
as it was difficult for them to deliver
blows on me without harming
Mrs. Alexander.
Meanwhile an Indian youth who
witnessed the incident had run to
the police station. The Police Superintendent,
Mr. Alexander, sent a
few men to ring me round and
take me safely to my destination.
They arrived in time. The police
station lay on our way. As we
reached there, the Superintendent
asked me to take refuge in the station,
but I gratefully declined the
offer. “They are sure to quiet down
when they realize their mistake,” I
said. “I have trust in their sense of
fairness.” Escorted by the police, I
arrived without further harm at Mr.
Rustomji's place. I had bruises all
over, but no wounds except in one
place. Dr. Dadibarjor, the ship's
doctor, who was on the spot, rendered
the best possible help.
There was quiet inside, but outside
the whites surrounded the
house. Night was coming on, and
the yelling crowd was shouting,
“We must have Gandhi.” The
quick-sighted Police Superintendent
was already there trying to
keep the crowd under control, not
by threats, but by humouring them.
But he was not entirely free from
anxiety. He sent me a message to
this effect : “If you would save
your friend's house and property
and also your family, you should
escape from the house in disguise,
as I suggest.”
As suggested by the
Sperintendent, I put on an Indian
constable's uniform and wore on
my head a Madrasi scarf, wrapped
round a plate to serve as a helmet.
Two detectives accompanied me,
one of them disguised as an Indian
merchant and with his face painted
to resemble that of an Indian. I
forget the disguise of the other. We
reached a neighbouring shop by a
52
by-lane and, making our way
through the gunny bags piled in
the godown, escaped by the gate of
the shop and made our way
through the crowd to a carriage
that had been kept for me at the
end of the street. In this we drove
off to the same police station
where Mr. Alexander had offered
me refuge a short time before, and
I thanked him and the detective
officers.
Whilst I had been thus effecting
my escape, Mr. Alexander had
kept the crowd amused by singing
the tune :
“Hang old Gandhi !
On the sour apple tree.”
When he was informed of my
safe arrival at the police station, he
thus broke the news to the crowd :
“Well, your victim has made good
his escape through a neighbouring
shop. You had better go home
now.” Some of them were angry,
others laughed, some refused to
believe the story.
“Well then,” said the Superintendent,
“if you do not believe me,
you may appoint one or two representatives,
whom I am ready to
take inside the house. If they succeed
in finding out Gandhi, I will
gladly deliver him to you. But if
they fail, you must disperse. I am
sure that you have no intention of
destroying Mr. Rustomji's house or
of harming Mr. Gandhi's wife and
children.”
The crowd sent their representatives
to search the house. They
soon returned with disappointing
news, and the crowd broke up at
last, most of them admiring the
Superintendent's tactful handling of
the situation, and a few fretting
and fuming.
The late Mr. Chamberlain, who
was then Secretary of State for the
Colonies, cabled asking the Natal
Government to prosecute my assailants.
Mr. Escombe sent for me,
expressed his regret for the injuries
I had sustained, and said : “Believe
me, I cannot feel happy over the
least little injury done to your person.
You had a right to accept Mr.
Laughton's advice and to face the
worst, but I am sure that, if you
had considered my suggestion
favourably, these sad occurrences
would not have happened. If you
can identify the assailants, I am
prepared to arrest and prosecute
them. Mr. Chamberlain also desires
me to do so.”
To which I gave the following
reply :
“I do not want to prosecute anyone.
It is possible that I may be
able to identify one or two of
them, but what is the use of getting
them punished? Besides, I do
not hold the assailants to blame.
53
They were given to understand that
I had made exaggerated and damaging
statements in India about the
whites in Natal. If they believed
these reports, it is no wonder that
they were enraged. The leaders
and, if you will permit me to say
so, you are to blame. You could
have guided the people properly,
but you also believed Reuter and
assumed that I must have indulged
in exaggeration. I do not want to
prosecute anyone. I am sure that,
when the truth becomes known,
they will be sorry for their conduct.”
“Would you mind giving me this
in writing ?” said Mr. Escombe.
“Because I shall have to cable to
Mr. Chamberlain to that effect. I
do not want you to make any statement
in haste. You may, if you
like, consult Mr. Laughton and
your other friends, before you
come to a final decision. I may
confess, however, that, if you set
aside the right of prosecuting your
assailants, you will considerably
help me in restoring quiet, besides
increasing your own reputation.”
“Thank you,” said I. “I need not
consult anyone. I had made my decision
in the matter before I came
to you. It is my conviction that I
should not prosecute the assailants,
and I am prepared this moment to
reduce my decision to writing.”
With this I gave him the necessary
statement.
On the day of landing, a representation
of the Natal Advertiser
had come to interview me. He had
asked me a number of questions,
and in reply I had been able to
refute every one of the charges that
had been levelled against me.
This interview and my refusal to
prosecute the assailants produced
such a profound impression that
the Europeans of Durban were
ashamed of their conduct. The
press declared me to be innocent
and condemned the mob. Thus the
lynching ultimately proved to be a
blessing for me, that is, for the
cause. It increased the prestige of
the Indian community in South Africa
and made my work easier. In
three or four days I went to my
house, and it was not long before I
settled down again.
26. SIMPLE LIFE
The washerman's bill was heavy,
and as he was besides by no means
noted for his punctuality, even two
to three dozen shirts and collars
proved insufficient for me. Collars
had to be changed daily and shirts,
54
if not daily, at least every alternate
day. This meant a double expense,
which appeared to me unnecessary.
So I equipped myself with a washing
outfit to save it. I bought a
book on washing, studied the art
and taught it also to my wife. This
no doubt added to my work, but its
novelty made it a pleasure.
I shall never forget the first collar
that I washed myself. I had used
more starch than necessary, the
iron had not been made hot
enough, and for fear of burning the
collar I had not pressed it sufficiently.
The result was that, though
the collar was fairly stiff, the superfluous
starch continually
dropped off it. I went to court with
the collar on, thus inviting the ridicule
of brother barristers, but even
in those days I could be indifferent
to ridicule.
“Well,” said I, “this is my first
experience at washing my own collars
and hence the loose starch. But
it does not trouble me, and then
there is the advantage of providing
you with so much fun.”
“But surely, there is no lack of
laundries here ?” asked a friend.
“The laundry bill is very heavy,”
said I. “The charge for washing a
collar is almost as much as its
price, and even then there is the
eternal dependence on the
washerman. I prefer by far to wash
my things myself.”
In the same way, as I freed myself
from slavery to the
washerman, I threw off dependence
on the barber. All people who go to
England learn there at least the art
of shaving, but none, to my knowledge,
learn to cut their own hair. I
had to learn that too. I once went
to an English hair-cutter in
Pretoria. He contemptuously refused
to cut my hair. I certainly felt
hurt, but immediately purchased a
pair of clippers and cut my hair
before the mirror. I succeeded more
or less in cutting the front hair, but
I spoiled the back. The friends in
the court shook with laughter.
“What's wrong with your hair,
Gandhi? Rats have been at it ?”
“No. The white barber would
not condescend to touch my black
hair,” said I, “so I preferred to cut
it myself, no matter how badly.”
The reply did not surprise the
friends.
The barber was not at fault in
having refused to cut my hair.
There was every chance of his losing
his customers, if he should
serve black men. We do not allow
our barbers to serve our ‘untouchable’
brethren. I got the reward of
this in South Africa, not once, but
many times, and the conviction that
it was the punishment for our own
sins saved me from becoming angry.
55
27. A RECOLLECTION AND PENANCE
When I was practising in
Durban, my office clerks often
stayed with me, and there were
among them Hindus and Christians,
or to describe them by their
provinces, Gujaratis and Tamilians.
I do not recollect having ever regarded
them as anything but my
kith and kin. One of the clerks was
a Christian, born of so-called untouchable
parents.
The house was built after the
Western model and the rooms
rightly had no outlets for dirty water.
Each room had therefore chamber-
pots. Rather than have these
cleaned by a servant or, a sweeper,
my wife or I attended to them. The
clerks who made themselves completely
at home would naturally
clean their own pots, but the
Christian clerk was a newcomer,
and it was our duty to attend to his
bedroom. My wife managed the
pots of the others, but to clean
those used by one who had been
‘untouchable’ seemed to her to be
the limit, and we fell out. She
could not bear the pots being
cleaned by me, neither did she like
doing it herself. Even today I can
recall the picture of her scolding
me, her eyes red with anger and
tears streaming down her cheeks,
as she descended the staircase, pot
in hand. But I was a cruelly kind
husband. I regarded myself as her
teacher, and so troubled her out of
my blind love for her.
I was far from being satisfied by
her merely carrying the pot. I would
have her do it cheerfully. So I said,
raising my voice : “I will not stand
this nonsense in my house.”
The words pierced her like an
arrow.
She shouted back : “Keep your
house to yourself and let me go.” I
forgot myself, and the spring of
compassion dried up in me. I
caught her by the hand, dragged
the helpless woman to the gate,
which was just opposite the staircase,
and proceeded to open it
with the intention of pushing her
out. The tears were running down
her cheeks in torrents, and she
cried : “Have you no sense of
shame ? Must you so far forget
yourself? Where am I to go? I
have no parents or relatives there
to shelter me. Being your wife,
you think I must put up with your
cuffs and kicks? For Heaven's sake
behave yourself, and shut the gate.
Let us not be found making scenes
like this !”
I put on a brave face, but was
really ashamed and shut the gate.
If my wife could not leave me,
56
neither could I leave her. We have
had numerous quarrels, but the end
has always been peace between us.
The wife, with her matchless powers
of endurance, has always been
the victor.
28. THE BOER WAR
I must skip many other experiences
of the period between 1897
and 1899 and come straight to the
Boer War.
I have minutely dealt with the
inner struggle regarding this in my
History of Satyagraha in South Africa,
and I must not repeat the argument
here. I invite the curious to
turn to those pages. Suffice it to
say that my loyalty to the British
rule drove me to participation with
the British in that war. I felt that, if
I demanded rights as a British citizen,
it was also my duty, as such,
to participate in the defence of the
British Empire.
Our corps was 1,100 strong,
with nearly 40 leaders. During
these days we had to march from
twenty to twenty-five miles a day,
bearing the wounded on stretchers.
Amongst the wounded we had the
honour of carrying soldiers like
General Woodgate. The corps was
disbanded after six weeks' service.
Our humble work was at the
moment much praised, and the Indians'
prestige was enhanced.

29. COSTLY GIFTS
On my relief from war-duty I
felt that my work was no longer in
South Africa but in India. Friends
at home were also pressing me to
return, and I felt that I should be
of more service in India. So I requested
my co-workers to relieve
me. After very great difficulty my
request was conditionally accepted,
the condition being that I should
be ready to go back to South Africa
if, within a year, the community
should need me. Farewell
meetings were arranged at every
place, and costly gifts were presented
to me. The gifts of course
included things in gold and silver,
but there were articles of diamond
as well.
The evening I was presented
with the bulk of these things I had
a sleepless night. I walked up and
down my room deeply agitated,
but could find no solution. It was
difficult for me to forgo gifts
worth hundreds, it was more difficult
to keep them.
And even if I could keep them,
what about my children? What
about my wife? They were being
trained to a life of service and to
an understanding that service was
its own reward.
I had no costly ornaments in the
house. We had been fast simplifying
our life. How then could we
afford to have gold watches? How
could we afford to wear gold
chains and diamond rings? Even
then I was telling people to conquer
the infatuation for jewellery.
What was I now to do with the
jewellery that had come upon me?
I decided that I could not keep
these things. I drafted a letter, creating
a trust of them in favour of
the community and appointing
Parsi Rustomji and others trustees.
In the morning I held a consultation
with my wife and children and
finally got rid of the heavy burden.
I knew that I should have some
difficulty in persuading my wife,
and I was sure that I should have
none so far as the children were
concerned. So I decided to constitute
them my pleaders.
The children readily agreed to
my proposal. ”We do not need
these costly presents, we must return
them to the community, and
should we ever need them, we
could easily purchase them,” they
said.
I was delighted. “Then you will
plead with mother, won't you ?” I
asked them.
“Certainly,” said they. “That is
our business. She does not need to
wear the ornaments. She would
58
want to keep them for us, and if
we don't want them, why should
she not agree to part with them ?”
But it was easier said than done.
“You may not need them,” said
my wife. “Your children may not
need them. Cajoled they will dance
to your tune. I can understand your
not permitting me to wear them.
But what about my daughters-inlaw?
They will be sure to need
them. And who knows what will
happen tomorrow? I would be the
last person to part with gifts so
lovingly given.”
And thus the torrent of argument
went on, strengthened in the end
by tears. But I was determined to
return the ornaments. I somehow
succeeded in the end in extorting a
consent from her. The gifts received
in 1896 and 1901 were all
returned. A trust-deed was prepared,
and they were deposited
with a bank, to be used for the
service of the community, according
to my wishes or to those of the
trustees.
I have never since regretted the
step, and as the years have gone
by, my wife has also seen its wisdom.
It has saved us from many
temptations.
I am definitely of opinion that a
public worker should accept no
costly gifts.
PART VII : BACK IN INDIA
30. MY FIRST CONGRESS
After reaching India I spent
some time in going about the
country. It was the year 1901 when
the Congress met at Calcutta under
the presidentship of Mr. (later Sir)
Dinshaw Wacha. And I of course
attended it. It was my first experience
of the Congress.
I asked a volunteer where I was
to go. He took me to the Ripon
College, where a number of delegates
were being put up. The volunteers
were clashing against one
another. You asked one of them to
do something. He sent you to another,
and he in his turn to a third
and so on; and as for the delegates,
they were neither here nor there.
There was no limit to insanitation.
Pools of water were everywhere.
There were only a few latrines,
and the recollection of their
stink still oppresses me. I pointed
it out to the volunteers. They said
point blank: “That is not our work,
it is the scavenger’s work.” I asked
for a broom. The man stared at me
in wonder. I got one and cleaned
59
the latrine. But that was for myself.
The rush was so great, and
the latrines were so few, that they
needed frequent cleaning; but that
was more than I could do.
There were yet two days for the
Congress session to begin. I had
made up my mind to offer my services
to the Congress office in order
to gain some experience. Babu
Bhupendranath Basu and Sjt.
Ghosal were the secretaries. I went
to Bhupenbabu and offered my services.
He looked at me, and said :
“I have no work, but possibly
Ghosalbabu might have something
to give you. Please go to him.”
So I went to him. He looked at
me and said with a smile: “I can
give you only clerical work. Will
you do it ?”
“Certainly,” said I. “I am here to
do anything that is not beyond my
capacity.”
Shri Ghosal used to get his shirt
buttoned by his bearer. I volunteered
to do the bearer's duty, and I
loved to do it, as my regard for
elders was always great. When he
came to know this, he did not
mind my doing little acts of personal
service for him. In fact he
was delighted. The benefit I received
from this service is incalculable.
In a few days I came to know
the working of the Congress. I met
most of the leaders.
Sir Pherozeshah had agreed to
admit my resolution on South Africa,
but I was wondering who
would put it before the Subjects
Committee, and when. For there
were lengthy speeches to every
resolution all in English and every
resolution had some well-known
leader to back it. As the night was
closing in, my heart beat fast. Everyone
was hurrying to go. It was
11 o'clock. I had not the courage to
speak. I had already met Gokhale,
who had looked at my resolution.
So I drew near his chair and whispered
to him : “Please do something
for me.”
“So we have done ?” said Sir
Pherozeshah Mehta.
“No, no, there is still the resolution
on South Africa. Mr. Gandhi
has been waiting long,” cried out
Gokhale.
“Have you seen the resolution ?”
asked Sir Pherozeshah.
“Of course.”
“Do you like it ?”
“It is quite good.”
“Well then, let us have it,
Gandhi.”
I read it trembling.
Gokhale supported it.
“Unanimously passed,” cried out
everyone.
“You will have five minutes to
speak to it Gandhi,” said Mr. Wacha.
60
The procedure was far from
pleasing to me. No one had
troubled to understand the resolution,
everyone was in a hurry to go
and because Gokhale had seen the
resolution, it was not thought necessary
for the rest to see it or understand
it !
And yet the very fact that it was
passed by the Congress was
enough to delight my heart. The
knowledge that the approval of the
Congress meant that of the whole
country was enough to delight anyone.
31. IN BOMBAY
Gokhale was very anxious that I
should settle down in Bombay,
practise at the bar and help in public
work.
I prospered in my profession
better than I had expected. My
South African clients often entrusted
me with some work, and it
was enough to enable me to pay
my way.
Just when I seemed to be settling
down as I had intended, I received
an unexpected cable from
South Africa: “Chamberlain expected
here. Please return immediately.”
I remembered my promise
and cabled to say that I should be
ready to start the moment they sent
me money. They promptly responded.
I gave up the chambers
and started for South Africa.
PART VIII : IN SOUTH AFRICA AGAIN
32. IN SOUTH AFRICA AGAIN
I reached Durban not a day too
soon. There was work waiting for
me. The date for the deputation to
wait on Mr. Chamberlain had been
fixed. I had to draft the memorial
to be submitted to him and accompany
the deputation.
Mr. Chamberlain, however, gave
a cold shoulder to the Indian deputation.
“You know,” he said, “that the
Imperial Government has little
control over self-governing Colonies.
Your grievances seem to be
genuine. I shall do what I can, but
you must try your best to placate
the Europeans, if you wish to live
in their midst.”
The reply cast a chill over the
members of the deputation. I was
61
my colleagues.
I added : “To tell you the truth,
the work for which you had called
me is practically finished. But I
believe I ought not to leave the
Transvaal, so far as it is possible,
even if you permit me to return
home. Instead of carrying on my
work from Natal, as before, I must
now do so from here. I must no
longer think of returning to India
within a year, but must get enrolled
in the Transvaal Supreme
Court. I have confidence enough to
deal with this new department. If
we do not do this, the community
will be driven out of the country.”
So I set the ball rolling, discussed
things with Indians in
Pretoria and Johannesburg, and ultimately
decided to set up office in
Johannesburg.
In his office at Johannesburg
South Africa
also disappointed. It was an eyeopener
for us all, and I saw that
we should start with our work
afresh. I explained the situation to
33. STUDY OF THE GITA
I already had faith in the Gita,
which had a fascination for me.
Now I realized the necessity of
diving deeper into it. I had one or
two translations, by means of
which I tried to understand the
original Sanskrit. I decided also to
get by heart one or two verses every
day. For this purpose I employed
the time of my morning ablutions.
The operation took me
thirty-five minutes, fifteen minutes
for the toothbrush and twenty for
the bath. So on the wall opposite I
stuck slips of paper on which were
written the Gita verses and referred
to them now and then to help my
memory. This time was found sufficient
for memorizing the daily
portion and recalling the verses already
learnt. I remember having
thus committed to memory thirteen
chapters.
To me the Gita became the
62
guide of conduct. It became my
dictionary of daily reference.
Words like aparigraha (non-possession)
and samabhava (equability)
gripped me. How to cultivate
and preserve that equability was
the question. Was I to give up all I
had and follow Him? Straight
came the answer: I could not follow
Him unless I gave up all I
had. I then wrote to
Ravishankerbhai to allow the insurance
policy to lapse and get
whatever could be recovered, or
else to regard the premiums already
paid as lost, for I had become
convinced that God, who
created my wife and children as
well as myself, would take care of
them. To my brother, who had
been as father to me, I wrote explaining
that I had given him all
that I had saved up to that moment,
but that henceforth he
should expect nothing from me,
for future savings, if any, would be
utilized for the benefit of the community.
34. THE MAGIC SPELL OF A BOOK
Mr. Polak, a friend of mine,
came to see me off to Durban, and
left with me a book to read during
the journey, which he said I was
sure to like. It was Ruskin's Unto
This Last.
The book was impossible to lay
aside, once I had begun it. It
gripped me. Johannesburg to
Durban was a twenty-four hours'
journey. The train reached there in
the evening. I could not get any
sleep that night. I determined to
change my life in accordance with
the ideals of the book.
I believe that I discovered some
of my deepest convictions reflected
in this great book of Ruskin, and
that is why it so captured me and
made me transform my life.
The teaching of Unto This Last I
understood to be :
1. That the good of the individual
is contained in the good of all.
2. That a lawyer's work has the
same value as the barber's inasmuch
as all have the same right of
earning their livelihood from their
work.
3. That a life of labour, i.e. the life
of the tiller of the soil and the handicraftsman
is the life worth living.
The first of these I knew. The
second I had dimly realized. The
third had never occurred to me.
Unto This Last made it as clear as
daylight for me that the second and
the third were contained in the first.
I arose with the dawn, ready to
reduce these principles to practice.
63
35. THE PHOENIX SETTLEMENT
I talked over the whole thing
with Mr. West, who was in charge
of the printing of Indian Opinion,
which was a weekly paper that I
was running, described to him the
effect Unto This Last had produced
on my mind, and proposed that Indian
Opinion should be removed
to a farm, on which everyone
should labour, drawing the same
living wage, and attending to the
press work in spare time. Mr. West
approved of the proposal, and £3
was laid down as the monthly allowance
per head, irrespective of
colour or nationality.
Thus the Phoenix Settlement
was started in 1904 and there in
spite of numerous odds Indian
Opinion continued to be published.
I had now given up all hope of
returning to India in the near future.
I had promised my wife that I
would return home within a year.
The year was gone without any
prospect of my return, so I decided
to send for her and the children.
36. THE ZULU REBELLION
Just when I felt that I should be
breathing in peace, an unexpected
event happened. The papers
brought the news of the outbreak
of the Zulu ‘rebellion’ in Natal. I
bore no grudge against the Zulus,
they had harmed no Indian. I had
doubts about the ‘rebellion’ itself.
But I then believed that the British
Empire existed for the welfare of
the world. Natal had a Volunteer
Defence Force.
I considered myself a citizen of
Natal, being intimately connected
with it. So I wrote to the Governor,
expressing my readiness, if
necessary, to form an Indian Ambulance
Corps. He replied immediately
accepting the offer.
I went to Durban and appealed
for men. In order to give me a
status and to facilitate work, as
also in accordance with the existing
convention, the Chief Medical
Officer appointed me to the temporary
rank of Sergeant Major and
three men selected by me to the
ranks of sergeants and one to that
of corporal. We also received our
uniforms from the Government.
Our Corps was on active service
for nearly six weeks. Our main
work was to be the nursing of the
wounded Zulus. The Medical Officer
in charge welcomed us. He
said the white people were not
64
willing nurses for the wounded
Zulus, that their wounds were festering,
and that he was at his wits'
end. He hailed our arrival as a
godsend for those innocent people.
37. KASTURBA’S COURAGE
A medical friend once advised a
surgical operation for my wife, to
which she agreed after some hesitation.
She was getting very thin,
and the doctor had to perform the
operation without chloroform. It
was successful, but she had to suffer
much pain. She, however, went
through it with wonderful bravery.
The doctor and his wife who
nursed her were all attention. This
was in Durban. The doctor gave
me leave to go to Johannesburg,
and told me not to have any anxiety
about the patient.
In a few days, however, I received
a letter to the effect that
Kasturba was worse, too weak to
sit up in bed, and had once become
unconscious. The doctor
knew that he might not, without
my consent give her wines or
meat. So he telephoned to me at
Johannesburg for permission to
give her beef tea. I replied saying
that I could not grant the permission,
but that, if she was in a condition
to express her wish in the
matter she might be consulted and
she was free to do as she liked.
“But,” said the doctor, “I refuse to
consult the patient's wishes in the
matter. You must come yourself. If
you do not leave me free to prescribe
whatever diet I like, I will
not hold myself responsible for
your wife's life.”
I took the train for Durban the
same day, and met the doctor who
quietly broke this news to me : “I
had already given Mrs. Gandhi
beef tea when I telephoned to
you.”
“Now, doctor, I call this a
fraud,” said I.
“No question of fraud in prescribing
medicine or diet for a patient.
In fact we doctors consider it
a virtue to deceive patients or their
relatives, if thereby we can save
our patients,” said the doctor with
determination.
I was deeply pained, but kept
cool. The doctor was a good man
and a personal friend. He and his
wife had laid me under a debt of
gratitude, but I was not prepared to
put up with his medical morals.
“Doctor, tell me what you propose
to do now. I would never allow
my wife to be given meat or
beef, even if the denial meant her
65
death, unless of course she desired
to take it.”
“You are welcome to your philosophy.
I tell you that, so long as
you keep your wife under my treatment,
I must have the option to
give her anything I wish. If you
don't like this, I must regretfully
ask you to remove her. I can't see
her die under my roof.”
I think one of my sons was with
me. He entirely agreed with me,
and said his mother should not be
given beef tea. I next spoke to
Kasturba herself. She was really
too weak to be consulted in this
matter. But I thought it my painful
duty to do so. I told her what had
passed between the doctor and myself.
She gave a firm reply : “I will
not take beef tea. It is a rare thing
in this world to be born as a human
being, and I would far rather
die in your arms than pollute my
body with such abominations.”
I pleaded with her. I told her
that she was not bound to follow
me. I cited to her the instances of
Hindu friends and acquaintances
who had no scruples about taking
meat or wine as medicine. But she
was adamant. “No,” said she,
“pray remove me at once.”
So we decided to leave the place
at once. It was drizzling and the
station was some distance. We had
to take the train from Durban for
Phoenix, whence our Settlement
was reached by a road of two
miles and a half. I was undoubtedly
taking a very great risk, but I
trusted in God, and proceeded with
my task. I sent a messenger to
Phoenix in advance, with a message
to West to receive us at the
station with a hammock, a bottle
of hot milk and one of hot water,
and six men to carry Kasturba in
the hammock. I got a rickshaw to
enable me to take her by the next
available train, put her into it in
that dangerous condition, and
marched away.
Kasturba needed no cheering up.
On the contrary, she comforted me,
saying : “Nothing will happen to
me. Don’t worry.”
She was mere skin and bone,
having had no nourishment for
days. The station platform was
very large and as the rickshaw
could not be taken inside, one had
to walk some distance before one
could reach the train. So I carried
her in my arms and put her into
the compartment. From Phoenix
we carried her in the hammock,
and there she slowly picked up
strength under water-cure treatment.
66
38. DOMESTIC SATYAGRAHA
Now it happened that Kasturba,
who was well for a brief period
after her operation, fell ill again.
She had not much faith in my remedies,
though she did not resist
them. She certainly did not ask for
outside help. So when all my remedies
had failed, I entreated her to
give up salt and pulses. She would
not agree, however much I pleaded
with her, supporting myself with
authorities. At last she challenged
me, saying that even I could not
give up these articles if I was advised
to do so. I was pained and
equally delighted, – delighted in
that I got an opportunity to shower
my love on her. I said to her :
“You are mistaken. If I was ailing
and the doctor advised me to give
up these or any other articles, I
should unhesitatingly do so. But
there ! Without any medical advice,
I give up salt and pulses for
one year, whether you do so or
not.”
She was rudely shocked and exclaimed
in deep sorrow : “Pray
forgive me. Knowing you, I should
not have provoked you. I promise
to go without these things, but for
heaven's sake take back your vow.
This is too hard on me.”
“It is very good for you to
forego these articles. I have not the
slightest doubt that you will be all
the better without them. As for me,
I cannot go back on a vow seriously
taken. And it is sure to benefit
me, for all restraint, whatever
prompts it, is wholesome for men.
You will therefore leave me alone.
It will be a test for me, and a
moral support to you in carrying
out your resolve.”
So she gave me up. “You are
too obstinate. You will listen to
none,” she said, and sought relief
in tears. I would like to count this
incident as an instance of
Satyagraha, and it is one of the
sweetest recollections of my life.
After this Kasturba began to pick
up quickly.
39. THE ADVENT OF SATYAGRAHA
On return from duty in connection
with the Zulu ‘Rebellion’ I
met the friends at Phoenix and
reached Johannesburg. Here I read
with deep horror the draft Ordinance
published in the Transvaal
Government Gazette Extraordinary
of August 22, 1906. It meant absolute
ruin for Indians in South Africa.
Under it every Indian, man,
67
woman or child of eight years or
upwards, entitled to reside in the
Transvaal, must register his or her
name with the Registrar of Asiatics
and take out a certificate of
regristration. The applicants for
registration must surrender their
old permits to the Registrar and
state in their applications their
name, residence, caste, age etc.
The Registrar was to note down
important marks of identification
upon the applicant's person, and
take his finger and thumb impressions.
Every Indian who failed thus
to apply for registration before a
certain date was to give up his
right of residence in the Transvaal.
Failure to apply would be held to
be an offence in law for which a
person could be fined, sent to
prison or even sent away from the
country. Even a person walking on
public thorough-fares could be required
to produce his certificate.
Police officers could enter private
houses in order to inspect certificates.
I have never known legislation
of this nature being directed
against free men in any part of the
world.
The next day there was held a
small meeting of the leading Indians
to whom I explained the Ordinance
word by word. It shocked
them as it had shocked me. All
present realized the seriousness of
A Satyagrahi in South Africa
the situation and resolved to hold a
public meeting.
The meeting was duly held on
September 11, 1906. The most important
among the resolutions
passed by the meeting was the famous
Fourth Resolution, by which
the Indians solemnly determined
not to submit to the Ordinance in
the event of its becoming law in
the teeth of their opposition, and to
suffer all the penalties attaching to
such non-submission.
None of us knew what name to
give to our movement. Shri
Maganlal Gandhi suggested the
word ‘Sadagraha’ meaning ‘firm68
ness in a good cause'. I liked the
word, but it did not fully represent
the whole idea I wished it to convey.
I therefore corrected it to
‘Satyagraha’. Truth (satya) implies
love, and firmness (agraha) brings
about and therefore serves as a
synonym for force. I thus began to
call the Indian movement
‘Satyagraha’, that is to say, the
force which is born of Truth and
Love or non-violence, and gave up
the use of the phrase ‘passive resistance’,
in connection with it.
40. IMPRISONMENT
The officers of the Asiatic Department
came to think the
strength of the movement could
not by any means be broken so
long as certain leaders were at
large. So they arrested some of us.
The community had resolved to
fill up the jail after our arrests.
We had been in jail for a fortnight,
when fresh arrivals brought
the news that there were going on
some negotiations about a compromise
with the Government. The
substance of the proposed settlement
was that the Indians should
register voluntarily and that if the
majority of the Indians underwent
voluntary registration, Government
should repeal the Black Act, as the
Asiatic Registration Act came to
be called.
I was taken to Pretoria to meet
General Smuts and after discussion
with him of an amendment I had
suggested, the draft settlement was
accepted. The prisoners were released
and I went about explaining
the terms of the settlement to my
countrymen.
41. ASSAULT
A couple of Pathans were angry
with me for consenting to the giving
of finger-prints. It had been
agreed that the leaders should be
the first to take out certificates on
the first day. When I reached my
office, which was also the office of
the Satyagraha Association, I
found Mir Alam, a Pathan, and his
companions standing outside the
premises. Mir Alam was an old
client of mine, and used to seek
my advice in all his affairs. He
was fully six feet in height and of
a large and powerful build. Today
for the first time I saw Mir Alam
outside my office instead of inside
it, and although his eyes met mine,
69
he for the first time did not salute
me. I saluted him and he saluted
me in return. But he did not today
wear his usual smile. I noticed his
angry eyes and took a mental note
of the fact. I thought that something
was going to happen. The
Chairman, Mr. Yusuf Mian and
other friends arrived, and we set
out for the Asiatic Office; Mir
Alam and his companions followed
us.
As we were not more than three
minutes’ walk from the Registration
Office, Mir Alam came up to
me and asked me, “Where are you
going ?”
“I propose to take out a certificate
of registration, giving the ten
finger-prints.” I replied. “If you
will go with me, I will first get
you a certificate with an impression
only of the two thumbs, and
then I will take one for myself,
giving the finger-prints.”
I had scarcely finished the last
sentence when a heavy cudgel
blow descended on my head from
behind. I at once fainted with the
words He Rama (O God !) on my
lips, lay flat on the ground and had
no notion of what followed. But
Mir Alam and his companions
gave me more blows and kicks,
some of which were warded off by
Yusuf Mian and Thambi Naidoo
with the result that they too were
beaten in their turn. The noise attracted
some European passers-by
to the scene. Mir Alam and his
companions fled but were caught
by the Europeans. The police arrived
in the meanwhile and took
them away. I was picked up and
carried into Mr. J. C. Gibson's private
office. When I regained consciousness,
I saw Mr. Doke bending
over me. “How do you feel ?”
he asked me.
“I am all right,” I replied, “but
there is pain in the teeth and the
ribs. Where is Mir Alam ?”
“He has been arrested along
with the rest.”
“They should be released.”
“That is all very well. But here
you are in a stranger's office with
your lip and cheek badly torn. The
police are ready to take you to the
hospital, but if you will go to my
place, Mrs. Doke and I will look
after you as best we can.”
“Yes, please take me to your
place. Thank the police for their
offer but tell them that I prefer to
go with you.”
Mr. Chamney, the Registrar of
Asiatic, too now arrived on the
scene. I was taken in a carriage to
this good clergy-man's residence in
Smit Street and a doctor was
called in. Meanwhile I said to Mr.
Chamney : “I wished to come to
your office, give ten finger-prints
70
and take out the first certificate of
registration, but God willed it otherwise.
However I have now to request
you to bring the papers and
allow me to register at once. I
hope that you will not let anyone
else register before me.”
“Where is the hurry about it ?”
asked Mr. Chamney. “The doctor
will be here soon. You please rest
yourself and all will be well. I will
issue certificate to others but keep
your name at the head of the list.”
“Not so,” I replied. “I am
pledged to take out the first certificate
if I am alive and if it is acceptable
to God. It is therefore that
I insist upon the papers being
brought here and now.”
Upon this Mr. Chamney went
away to bring the papers.
The second thing for me to do
was to write to the Attorney-General
that I did not hold Mir Alam
and others guilty for the assault
committed upon me, that in any
case I did not wish them to be
prosecuted and that I hoped they
would be let off for my sake. But
the Europeans of Johannesburg addressed
a strong letter to the Attorney-
General saying that whatever
views Gandhi might hold as regards
the punishment of criminals,
they could not be given effect to in
South Africa. Gandhi himself
might not take any steps, but the
assault was committed not in a private
place but on the high roads
and was therefore public offence.
Several Englishmen too were in a
position to tender evidence and the
offenders must be prosecuted.
Upon this the Attorney-General rearrested
Mir Alam and one of his
companions who were sentenced
to three months' hard labour. Only
I was not summoned as a witness.
I addressed a short note as follows
to the community through the
Chairman and sent it for publication
:
“I am well in the brotherly and
sisterly hands of Mr. and Mrs.
Doke. I hope to take up my duty
shortly.
“Those who have committed the
act did not know what they were
doing. They thought that I was doing
what was wrong. They have
had their revenge in the only manner
they know. I therefore request
that no steps be taken against
them.”
Mr. Chamney returned with the
papers and I gave my finger-prints
but not without pain. I then saw
that tears stood in Mr. Chamney's
eyes. I had often to write bitterly
against him, but this showed me
how man's heart may be softened
by events.
71
42. RESUMPTION OF SATYAGRAHA
The Indians had registered voluntarily.
The Government were,
therefore, on their part to repeal
the Black Act. But instead of repealing
the Black Act, General
Smuts maintained the Black Act
on the statute book and introduced
into the legislature a measure,
‘making further provision for the
registration of Asiatics’: I was
shocked when I read the Bill.
An ‘Ultimatum’ was sent to the
Government by the Satyagrahis. It
said in effect, ”If the Asiatic Act is
not repealed, the certificates collected
by the Indians would be
burnt, and they would humbly but
firmly take the consequences.”
A meeting had been called to
perform the public ceremony of
burning the certificates.
As the business of the meeting
was about to commence, a volunteer
arrived on a cycle with a telegram
from the Government in
which they regretted the determination
of the Indian community
and announced their inability to
change their line of action. The
telegram was read to the audience
which received it with cheers, as if
they were glad that the auspicious
opportunity of burning the certificates
did not after all slip out of
their hands.
Mir Alam too was present at
this meeting. He announced that he
had done wrong to assault me as
he did, and to the great joy of the
audience, handed his original certificate
to be burnt, as he had not
taken a voluntary certificate. I took
hold of his hand, pressed it with
joy, and assured him once more
that I had never had in my mind
any resentment against him.
The Committee had already received
upwards of 2,000 certificates
to be burnt. These were all
thrown into the fire, soaked with
kerosene oil and set ablaze by Mr.
Yusuf Mian. The whole assembly
rose to their feet and made the
place resound with the echoes of
their continuous cheers during the
burning process. Some of those
who had still withheld their certificates
brought them in numbers to
the platform, and these too were
thrown to the flames.
The reporters of English newspapers
present at the meeting were
profoundly impressed with the
whole scene and gave vivid descriptions
of the meeting in their
papers.
During the same year in which
the Black Act was passed General
Smuts carried through the Legislature
another Bill called the
72
Transvaal Immigrants Restriction
Bill. This Act indirectly prevented
the entry of a single Indian newcomer
into the Transvaal.
It was absolutely essential for
the Indians to resist this fresh inroad
on their rights. Several
Satyagrahis therefore deliberately
entered the Transvaal and were imprisoned.
I too was arrested again.
Gokhale came to South Africa
in October 1912 to mediate between
the Satyagrahis and the
Government. General Botha, according
to Gokhale, promised him
that the Black Act would be repealed
in a year and the £ 3 tax
abolished. But this was not done.
I wrote to Gokhale about the
breach of the pledge and set about
making preparations for the ensuing
campaign.
Till now we had dissuaded
women from courting imprisonment.
But at this time judgement
was passed by the South African
Government which made invalid
all marriages that had not been celebrated
according to Christian rites
and registered by the Registrar of
Marriages. Thus at a stroke of the
pen all marriages celebrated according
to Hindu, Mussalman and
Zoroastrian rites became illegal,
and the wives concerned were degraded
to the rank of concubines
and their children deprived of the
right to inherit property. This was
an unbearable situation for women
no less than men.
Patience was impossible in the
place of this insult offered to our
womanhood. We decided to offer
stubborn Satyagraha irrespective of
the number of fighters. Not only
could the women now be not prevented
from joining the struggle,
but we decided even to invite them
to come into line along with the
men.
The women’s imprisonment
worked like a charm upon the
labourers on the mines near
Newcastle who downed their tools
and entered the city in succeeding
batches. As soon as I received the
news, I left Phoenix for Newcastle.
The labourers were not to be
counted by tens but by hundreds.
And their number might easily
swell into thousands. How was I to
house and feed this ever growing
multitude? There was a huge gathering
of men, which was continuously
increasing. It was a dangerous
if not an impossible task to
keep them in one place and look
after them while they had no employment.
I thought out a solution
of my problem. I must take this
‘army’ to the Transvaal and see
them safely deposited in jail. The
strength of the ‘army’ was about
five thousand.
73
43. THE TRIUMPH OF SATYAGRAHA
The Union Government had not
the power to keep thousands of innocent
men in jail. The Viceroy
would not tolerate it, and all the
world was waiting to see what
General Smuts would do. The
Union Government now did what
all governments similarly situated
generally do. They get out of such
awkward position by appointing a
commission. It is a general practice
that the recommendations of such
a commission should be accepted
by the State, and therefore under
the guise of carrying out the recommendations,
governments give
the justice which they have first
refused. General Smuts appointed
a commission of three members.
I entered into correspondence
with General Smuts over the work
of the commission and came to
agreement. The commission in its
report recommended acceptance of
the demands of the Indian community;
and within a short time after
the issue of the report, the Government
published in the official Gazette
of the Union the Indians' Relief
Bill which abolished the £ 3
tax, made legal all marriages
deemed legal in India, and made a
domicile certificate bearing the
holder's thumb-print sufficient evi-
Gandhiji and Kasturba :
In South Africa, 1913
dence of the right to enter the
Union.
Thus the great Satyagraha
struggle closed after eight years,
and it appeared that the Indians in
South Africa were now at peace.
On July 18, 1914, I sailed for England
on my way back to India. It
was difficult for me to leave South
Africa, where I had passed twentyone
years of my life sharing to the
full in the sweets and bitters of
human experience and where I had
realized my calling in life.
74
PART IX : IN INDIA AND FOUNDING OF THE ASHRAM
44. IN POONA
It was a joy to get back to the
homeland after so many years of
exile.
Gokhale and the members of the
Servants of India Society* overwhelmed
me with affection. So far
as I recollect, Gokhale got all of
them together to meet me. I had a
frank talk with them all on every
sort of subject.
I wanted to have an Ashram
where I could settle down with my
Phoenix family, preferably somewhere
in Gujarat, as being a
Gujarati, I thought I was best fitted
to serve the country through serving
Gujarat. Gokhale liked the
idea. He said: “You should certainly
do so. You must look to me
for the expenses of the Ashram,
which I will regard as my own.”
My heart overflowed with joy. It
*Founded by Gokhale and consisting of men pledged to devote all their lives to the
service of the country on such allowances as the society may be able to give. Its work
covers many fields - political, social, economic and educational; moderate in politics, it
is a non-communal organization which does not recognize caste distinctions. It conducts
several institutions throughout the country. – Ed.
Arrival in India after
successful Satyagraha
was a pleasure to feel free from
the responsibility of raising funds.
75
76
77
The Satyagraha Ashram was
founded on the 25th of May, 1915
at Kochrab in Ahmedabad.
We were in all about twenty-five
men and women. All had their
meals in a common kitchen and
strove to live as one family.
The Ashram had been in existence
only a few months when we
were put to a test such as I had
scarcely expected. I received a letter
from Amritlal Thakkar to this
effect : “A humble and honest untouchable
family is desirous of
joining your Ashram. Will you accept
them ?”
I wrote to Amritlal Thakkar expressing
our willingness to accept
the family, provided all the members
were ready to abide by the
rules of the Ashram.
They all agreed to abide by the
rules and were accepted.
But their admission created a
stir amongst the friends who had
been helping the Ashram. The very
first difficulty was found with regard
to the use of the well, which
was partly controlled by the owner
of the bungalow. The man in
charge of the water-lift objected
that drops of water from our
bucket would pollute him. So he
took to swearing at us. I told everyone
to put up with the abuse
45. FOUNDING OF THE ASHRAM
and continue drawing water at any
cost. When he saw that we did not
return his abuse, the man became
ashamed and ceased to bother us.
All monetary help, however, was
stopped. With the stopping of
monetary help came rumours of
proposed social boycott. We were
prepared for all this. I had told my
companions that, if we were boycotted
and denied the usual facilities,
we would not leave
Ahmedabad. We would rather go
and stay in the ‘untouchables’
quarter and live on whatever we
could get by manual labour.
Matters came to such a pass that
Maganlal Gandhi one day gave me
this notice : “We are out of funds
and there is nothing for the next
month.”
I quietly replied : “Then we
shall go to the ‘untouchables’
quarter.”
This was not the first time I had
been faced with such a trial. On all
such occasions God has sent help
at the last moment. One morning
shortly after Maganlal had given
me warning of our monetary
plight, one of the children came
and said that a Sheth who was
waiting in a car outside wanted to
see me. I went out to him. “I want
to give the Ashram some help.
78
Will you accept it ?” he asked.
“Most certainly,” said I. “And I
confess I am at the present moment
at the end of my resources.”
“I shall come tomorrow at this
time,” he said. “Will you be
here ?”
“Yes,” said I, and he left.
Next day, exactly at the appointed
hour, the car drew up near
our quarters, and the horn was
blown. The children came with the
news. The Sheth did not come in. I
went out to see him. He placed in
my hands currency notes of the
value of Rs. 13,000 and drove away.
I had never expected this help,
and what a novel way of rendering
it! The gentleman had never before
visited the Ashram. So far as I can
remember, I had met him only
once. No visit, no enquiries, simply
rendering help and going
away! This was a unique experience
for me. We now felt quite
safe for a year.
PART X : CHAMPARAN
46. THE STAIN OF INDIGO
The Champaran tenant was
bound by law to plant three out of
every twenty parts of his land with
indigo for his landlord. This system
was known as tinkathia system
as, three kathas out of twenty
(which make one acre) had to be
planted with indigo.
Rajkumar Shukla was one of the
agriculturists who had suffered under
this system. He wanted me
personally to visit Champaran and
see the miseries of the ryots there.
So early in 1917 we left
Calcutta for Champaran. My object
was to inquire into the condition of
the Champaran agriculturists and
understand their grievances against
the indigo planters. For this purpose
it was necessary that I should
meet thousands of the ryots. But I
thought it essential, before starting
on my inquiry, to know the planters'
side of the case and see the
Commissioner of the Division. I
sought and was granted appointments
with both.
The Secretary of the Planters'
Association told me plainly that I
was an outsider and that I had no
business to come between the
planters and their tenants, but if I
had any representation to make, I
might submit it in writing. I politely
told him that I did not regard
myself as an outsider, and that I
had every right to inquire into the
condition of the tenants if they de79
sired me to do so.
The Commissioner, on whom I
called, advised me forthwith to
leave Tirhut.
I acquainted my co-workers with
all this, and told them that there
was a likelihood of Government
stopping me from proceeding further,
and that I might have to go to
jail earlier than I had expected, and
that, if I was to be arrested, it
would be best that the arrest
should take place in Motihari or if
possible in Bettiah. It was advisable,
therefore, that I should go to
those places as early as possible.
Champaran is a district of the
Tirhut division in Bihar, and
Motihari is its headquarters.
Rajkumar Shukla's place was in
the vicinity of Bettiah, and the tenants
in its neighbourhood were the
poorest in the district. Rajkumar
Shukla wanted me to see them and
I was equally anxious to do so.
So I started with my co-workers
for Motihari the same day. The
very same day we heard that about
five miles from Motihari a tenant
had been ill-treated. It was decided
that, in company with Babu
Dharanidhar Prasad, I should go
and see him the next morning, and
we accordingly set off for the
place on elephant's back. We had
scarcely gone half way when a
messenger from the Police Superintendent
overtook us and said that
the latter had sent his compliments.
I saw what he meant. Having
left Dharanidhar Babu to proceed
to the original destination, I
got into the hired carriage which
the messenger had brought. He
then served on me a notice to
leave Champaran, and drove me to
my place. On his asking me to acknowledge
the service of the notice,
I wrote to the effect that I did
not propose to leave Champaran
till my inquiry was finished.
Thereupon I received a summons
to take my trial the next day for
disobeying the order to leave
Champaran.
The news of the notice and the
summons spread like wildfire, and
I was told that Motihari that day
witnessed unprecedented scenes.
Gorakhbabu's house and the courthouse
overflowed with men. Fortunately
I had finished all my work
during the night and so was able to
manage the crowds. My companions
proved the greatest help. They
occupied themselves with regulating
the crowds, for the latter followed
me wherever I went.
A sort of friendliness sprang up
between the officials – Collector,
Magistrate, Police Superintendent
– and myself. I might have legally
resisted the notices served on me.
Instead I accepted them all, and
80
my conduct towards the officials
was correct. They thus saw that I
did not want to offend them personally,
but that I wanted to offer
civil resistance to their orders. In
this way they were put at ease, and
instead of harassing me they gladly
availed themselves of my and my
co-workers' co-operation in regulating
the crowds. But it was a visible
demonstration to them of the
fact that their authority was
shaken. The people had for the
moment lost all fear of punishment
and yielded obedience to the
power of love which their new
friends exercised.
It should be remembered that no
one knew me in Champaran. And
yet they received me as though we
had been age-long friends. It is no
exaggeration, but the literal truth,
to say that in this meeting with the
peasants I was face to face with
God, Ahimsa, and Truth.
That day in Champaran was an
unforgettable event in my life and
a red-letter day for the peasants
and for me.
The trial began. The Government
pleader, the Magistrate and
other officials were at a loss to
know what to do.
Before I could appear before the
Court to receive the sentence, the
Magistrate sent a written message
that the Lieutenant Governor had
ordered the case against me to be
withdrawn, and the Collector wrote
to me saying that I was at liberty
to conduct the proposed inquiry,
and that I might count on whatever
help I needed from the officials.
None of us was prepared for this
prompt and happy issue.
Crowds of peasants came to
make their statements, and they
were followed by an army of companions
who filled the compound
and garden to over-flowing.
47. THE STAIN REMOVED
The ever growing number of
ryots coming to make their statements
increased the planters'
wrath, and they moved heaven
and earth to put an end to my
inquiry.
But Sir Edward Gait, the Lieutenant
Governor, asked me to see
him, expressed his willingness to
appoint an inquiry and invited
me to be a member of the Committee.
The Committee voted in favour
of the ryots, and recommended
that the planters should refund a
portion of the exactions made by
them which the Committee had
found to be unlawful, and that
81
the tinkathia system should be
abolished by law.
The tinkathia system which had
been in existence for about a century
was thus abolished, and with
it the planters’ raj came to an end.
PART XI : AHMEDABAD LABOUR
48. IN TOUCH WITH LABOUR
At this time there came a letter
from Shrimati Anasuyabehn about
the condition of labour in
Ahmedabad. Wages were low, the
labourers had long been agitating
for an increment, and I had a desire
to guide them if I could. So I
went to Ahmedabad.
I was in a most delicate situation.
The mill-hands' case was
strong. Shrimati Anasuyabehn had
to battle against her own brother,
Shri Ambalal Sarabhai, who led
the fight on behalf of the millowners.
My relations with them
were friendly, and that made fighting
with them the more difficult. I
held consultations with them, and
requested them to refer the dispute
to arbitration, but they refused to
recognize the principle of arbitration.
I had therefore to advise the
labourers to go on strike. Before I
did so, I came in very close contact
with them and their leaders,
and explained to them the conditions
of a successful strike:
1. never to resort to violence,
2. never to molest blacklegs,
3. never to depend upon alms,
and
4. to remain firm, no matter how
long the strike continued, and to
earn bread, during the strike, by
any other honest labour.
The leaders of the strike understood
and accepted the conditions,
and the labourers pledged themselves
at a general meeting not to
resume work until either their
terms were accepted or the millowners
agreed to refer the dispute
to arbitration.
For the first two weeks the millhands
exhibited great courage and
self-restraint and daily held large
meetings. On these occasions I
used to remind them of their
pledge, and they would shout back
to me the assurance that they
would rather die than break their
word.
But later they began to show
signs of weakening. I felt deeply
troubled and began thinking hard
as to what my duty was in the circumstances.
82
One morning – it was at a millhands'
meeting – while I was still
groping and unable to see my way
clearly, the light came to me. Unbidden
and all by themselves the
words came to my lips : “Unless
the strikers rally,” I declared to the
meeting, “and continue the strike
till a settlement is reached, or till
they leave the mills altogether, I
will not touch any food.”
The labourers were
thunderstruck. Tears began to
course down Anasuyabehn's
cheeks. The labourers broke out,
“Not you but we shall fast. It
would be monstrous if you were to
fast. Please forgive us for our
lapse, we will now remain faithful
to our pledge to the end.”
“There is no need for you to
fast,” I replied. “It would be
enough if you could remain true to
your pledge. As you know we are
without funds, and we do not want
to continue our strike by living on
public charity. You should therefore
try to earn your bare living by
some kind of labour, so that you
may be able to remain unconcerned,
no matter how long the
strike may continue. As for my
fast, it will be broken only after
the strike is settled.”
Anasuyabehn and a number of
other friends and labourers shared
the fast with me on the first day.
But after some difficulty I was
able to dissuade them from continuing
it further.
The net result of it was that an
atmosphere of goodwill was created
all round. The hearts of the
mill-owners were touched, and
they set about discovering some
means for a settlement.
Anasuyabehn's house became the
meeting place for their discussions.
Shri Anandshankar Dhruva intervened
and was in the end appointed
arbitrator, and the strike
was called off after I had fasted
only for three days. The mill-owners
commemorated the event by
distributing sweets among the
labourers, and thus a settlement
was reached after 21 days’ strike.
PART XII : THE KHEDA SATYAGRAHA
49. THE KHEDA SATYAGRAHA
No breathing time was, however,
in store for me. Hardly was
the Ahmedabad mill-hands' strike
over, when I had to plunge into the
Kheda Satyagraha struggle.
A condition approaching famine
83
had arisen in the Kheda district
owing to a widespread failure of
crops, and the Patidars of Kheda
were considering the question of
getting the Government not to collect
its land revenue for the year.
Under the Land Revenue Rules,
if the crop was four annas* or under,
the cultivators could claim full
suspension of payment of revenue
for the year. According to the official
figures the crop was said to be
over four annas. The contention of
the cultivators, on the other hand,
was that it was less than four
annas. But the Government was in
no mood to listen. At last all petitioning
and prayer having failed,
after taking counsel with co-workers,
I advised the Patidars to resort
to Satyagraha.
In the initial stages, though the
people exhibited much courage,
the Government did not seem inclined
to take strong action. But as
the people's firmness showed no
signs of wavering, the Government
began coercion. The attachment officers
sold people's cattle and
seized whatever movables they
could lay hands on. Penalty notices
were served, and in some cases
standing crops were attached.
With a view to steeling the
hearts of those who were frightened,
I advised the people, under
the leadership of Shri Mohanlal
Pandya, to remove the crop of onion
from a field which had been,
in my opinion, wrongly attached.
This was a good opportunity for
the people to learn a lesson in
courting fines or imprisonment,
which was the necessary consequence
of such disobedience. For
Shri Mohanlal Pandya it was a
thing after his heart. So he volunteered
to remove the onion crop
from the field, and in this seven or
eight friends joined him.
*i.e. four annas in the rupee (16 annas), or one-fourth the normal.
Kheda Satyagraha : 1918
84
It was impossible for the Government
to leave them free. The
arrest of Shri Mohanlal and his
companions added to the people's
enthusiasm. When the fear of jail
disappears, repression puts heart
into the people.
A procession escorted the ‘convicts’
to jail, and on that day Shri
Mohanlal Pandya earned from the
people the honoured title of`dungli
chor (onion thief) which he enjoys
to this day.
I was looking for some graceful
way of ending the struggle which
would be acceptable to a
Satyagrahi. Such a one appeared
quite unexpectedly. The Mamlatdar
of the Nadiad Taluka sent me word
that, if well-to-do Patidars paid up,
the poorer ones would be permitted
not to pay. I asked for a written
undertaking to that effect, which
was given. I inquired of the Collector,
who alone could give an
undertaking in respect of the whole
district, whether the Mamlatdar's
undertaking was true for the whole
district. He replied that orders in
terms of the Mamlatdar's letter had
been already issued. I was not
aware of it, but if it was a fact, the
people's pledge had been fulfilled.
The pledge, it will be remembered,
had the same thing for its object,
and so we expressed ourselves satisfied
with the orders.
The Kheda Satyagraha marks
the beginning of an awakening
among the peasants of Gujarat, the
beginning of their true political
education. The lesson became
firmly impressed on the public
mind that the salvation of the
people depends upon themselves,
upon the capacity for suffering and
sacrifice. Through the Kheda campaign
Satyagraha took firm root in
the soil of Gujarat.
50. NEAR DEATH’S DOOR
In those days my food principally
consisted of groundnut butter
and lemons. I knew that it was
possible to eat too much butter and
injure one's health, and yet I allowed
myself to do so. This gave
me a slight attack of dysentery.
There was some festival that
day, and although I had told
Kasturba that I should have nothing
for my midday meal, she
tempted me and I yielded. As I
was under a vow of taking no milk
or milk products, she had specially
prepared for me a sweet wheat
porridge with oil added to it instead
of ghee. She had reserved
too a bowlful of mung for me. I
85
was fond of these things, and I
readily took them, hoping that
without coming to grief I should
eat just enough to please Kasturba
and to satisfy my palate. But the
devil had been only waiting for an
opportunity. Instead of eating very
little I had my fill of the meal.
This was sufficient invitation to
the angel of death. Within an hour
the dysentery appeared in acute
form.
I would take no medicine, but
preferred to suffer the penalty for
my folly. I must have had thirty to
forty motions in twenty-four hours.
I fasted, not taking even fruit
juices in the beginning. The appetite
had all gone, I felt that I was
at death's door.
Whilst I lay thus ever expectant
of death, Shankerlal Bankar constituted
himself the guardian of my
health, and pressed me to consult
Dr. Dalal. Dr. Dalal was called accordingly.
His capacity for taking
instantaneous decisions captured
me.
He said : “I cannot rebuild your
body unless you take milk. If in
addition you would take iron and
arsenic injections, I would guarantee
fully to make you well.”
“You can give me the injections,”
I replied, “but milk is a different
question; I have a vow
against it.”
“What exactly is the nature of
your vow ?” the doctor inquired.
I told him the whole history and
the reasons behind my vow, how,
since I had come to know that the
cow and the buffalo were subjected
to the process of phuka, I
had taken a strong disgust for
milk. Moreover, I had always held
that milk is not the natural diet of
man. I had therefore given up its
use altogether. Kasturba was standing
near my bed listening all the
time to this conversation.
“But surely you cannot have any
objection to goat's milk then,” she
said.
The doctor added : “If you will
take goat's milk, it will be enough
for me.”
I gave in. My intense eagerness
to take up the Satyagraha fight had
created in me a strong desire to
live, and so I contended myself
with adhering to the letter of my
vow only, and sacrificed its spirit.
For although I had only the milk
of the cow and the she-buffalo in
mind when I took the vow, by
natural implication it covered the
milk of all animals. Nor could it
be right for me to use milk at all,
so long as I held that milk is not
the natural diet of man. Yet knowing
all this I agreed to take goat's
milk. The memory of this action
even now fills me with remorse,
86
and I am constantly thinking how
to give up goat's milk. But I cannot
yet free myself from that subtlest
of temptations, the desire to
serve, which still holds me.
Soon after I began taking goat's
milk, Dr. Dalal performed on me a
successful operation. As I was getting
better, my desire to live revived,
especially because God had
kept work in store for me.
PART XIII : THE ROWLATT ACT AND
ENTRANCE INTO POLITICS
51. THE ROWLATT ACT*
I had hardly begun to feel my
way towards recovery, when I happened
casually to read in the papers
the Rowlatt Committee's report
which had just been published.
Its recommendations
startled me. I mentioned my apprehensions
to Vallabhbhai, who used
to come to see me almost daily.
“Something must be done,” said I
to him. “But what can we do in
the circumstances?' he asked in reply.
I answered, “If even a handful
of men can be found to sign the
pledge of resistance, and the proposed
measure is passed into law
in defiance of it, we ought to offer
Satyagraha at once. If I was not
laid up like this, I should give
battle against it all alone, and expect
others to follow suit. But in
my present helpless condition I
feel myself to be altogether unequal
to the task.”
The Bill had not yet been
gazetted as an Act. I was in a very
weak condition, but when I received
an invitation from Madras I
decided to take the risk of the long
journey. Rajagopalachari had then
only recently left Salem to settle
down for legal practice in Madras.
We daily discussed together plans
of the fight, but beyond the holding
of public meetings I could not
then think of any other
programme.
While we were engaged thus,
news was received that the Rowlatt
Bill had been published as an Act.
That night I fell asleep while
thinking over the question. To-
*This act was passed in 1919 to provide special powers to the Government to
suppress movements aimed against the State. It authorised arrest and detention, without
trial, of persons suspected of anti-government activities. – Ed.
87
wards the small hours of the morning
I woke up somewhat earlier
than usual. I was still in that twilight
condition between sleep and
consciousness when suddenly the
idea came to me – it was as if in a
dream. Early in the morning I related
the whole story to
Rajagopalachari.
“The idea came to me last night
in a dream that we should call
upon the country to observe a general
hartal. Satyagraha is a process
of self-purification, and ours is a
sacred fight, and it seems to me to
be in the fitness of things that it
should be begun with an act of
self-purification. Let all the people
of India, therefore, stop their business
on that day and observe the
day as one of fasting and prayer.”
Rajagopalachari was at once
taken up with my suggestion.
Other friends too welcomed it
when it was communicated to
them later. I drafted a brief appeal.
The date of the hartal was first
fixed on the 30th March 1919, but
was later changed to 6th April.
The whole of India from one
end to the other, towns as well as
villages, observed a complete
hartal on that day. It was a most
wonderful sight.
On the night of the 7th I started
for Delhi and Amritsar. Before the
train had reached Palwal railway
station, I was served with a written
order to the effect that I was prohibited
from entering the boundary
of the Punjab, as my presence
there was likely to result in a disturbance
of the peace. I was asked
by the police to get down from the
train. I refused to do so saying, “I
want to go to the Punjab in response
to a pressing invitation, not
to foment unrest, but to end it. I
am therefore sorry that it is not
possible for me to comply with
this order.”
At Palwal railway station I was
taken out of the train and put under
police custody. A train from
Delhi came in a short time. I was
made to enter a third class carriage,
the police party accompanying.
On reaching Mathura, I was
taken to the police barracks, but no
police official could tell me as to
what they proposed to do with me
or where I was to be taken next.
Early at 4 o'clock the next morning,
I was waked up and put in a
goods train that was going towards
Bombay. I was released at
Bombay.
There was a great disturbance in
the city owing to my arrest. I got
into the car. Near Pydhuni* I saw
*a part of Bombay city
88
that a huge crowd had gathered.
On seeing me the people went mad
with joy. A procession was immediately
formed, and the sky was
rent with the shouts of Vande
Mataram and Allaho Akbar. At
Pydhuni we sighted a body of
mounted police. Brickbats were
raining down from above. I appealed
to the crowd to be calm but
it seemed as if we should not be
able to escape the shower of brickbats.
As the procession came out
of Abdur Rahman Street and was
about to move towards the
Crawford Market, it suddenly
found itself faced with a body of
the mounted police, who had arrived
there to prevent it from proceeding
further in the direction of
the Fort. The crowd was densely
packed. It had almost broken
through the police cordon. There
was hardly any chance of my voice
being heard in that vast assembly.
Just then the officer in charge of
the mounted police gave the order
to disperse the crowd, and at once
the mounted party charged upon
the crowd brandishing their lances
as they went. For a moment I felt
that I would be hurt. But my fear
was groundless, the lances just
grazed the car as the lancers
swiftly passed by. The ranks of the
people were soon broken, and they
were thrown into utter confusion,
and began to run. Some got
trampled under foot, others were
badly hurt and crushed. In that
seething mass of humanity there
was hardly any room for the horses
to pass, nor was there any exit by
which the people could disperse.
So the lancers blindly cut their
way through the crowd. I hardly
imagine they could see what they
were doing. The whole thing presented
a most dreadful spectacle.
The horsemen and the people were
mixed together in mad confusion.
Thus the crowd was dispersed and
its progress checked. Our motor was
allowed to proceed. I had it stopped
before the Commissioner's office,
and got down to complain to him
about the conduct of the police.
News came of disturbances in
Ahmedabad also. I proceeded to
Ahmedabad. I learnt that an attempt
had been made to pull up
the rails near the Nadiad railway
station, that a Government officer
had been murdered in Viramgam,
and that Ahmedabad was under
martial law. The people were terror-
stricken. They had indulged in
acts of violence and were being
made to pay for them with interest.
A police officer was waiting at
the station to escort me to Mr.
Pratt, the Commissioner. I found
him in a state of rage. I spoke to
him gently, and expressed my re89
gret for the disturbances. I suggested
that martial law was unnecessary,
and declared my readiness
to co-operate in all efforts to restore
peace. I asked for permission
to hold a public meeting on the
grounds of the Sabarmati Ashram.
The proposal appealed to him, and
the meeting was held, I think, on
Sunday, the 13th of April, and
martial law was withdrawn the
same day or the day after. Addressing
the meeting, I tried to bring
home to the people the sense of
their wrong, declared a penitential
fast of three days for myself, appealed
to the people to go on a
similar fast for a day, and suggested
to those who had been
guilty of acts of violence to confess
their guilt.
I saw my duty as clear as daylight.
It was unbearable for me to
find that the labourers, amongst
whom I had spent a good deal of
my time, whom I had served and
from whom I had expected better
things, had taken part in the riots; I
felt I was a sharer in their guilt.
I made up my mind to suspend
Satyagraha so long as people had
not learnt the lesson of peace.
PART XIV : THE BIRTH OF KHADI
52. THE BIRTH OF KHADI
When the Satyagraha Ashram
was founded at Sabarmati, we introduced
a few handlooms there.
The object that we in the
Ashram set before ourselves was
to be able to clothe ourselves entirely
in cloth manufactured by our
own hands. We therefore forthwith
gave up the use of mill-woven
cloth, and all the members of the
Ashram resolved to wear handwoven
cloth made from Indian
yarn only. By thus adopting cloth
woven from mill-yarn as our wear,
and propagating it among our
friends, we made ourselves voluntary
agents of the Indian spinning
mills. This in its turn brought us
into contact with the mills. We
saw that the aim of the mills was
more and more to weave the yarn
spun by them; their co-operation
with the handloom weaver was not
willing, but unavoidable and temporary.
We became impatient to be
able to spin our own yarn. It was
clear that until we could do this
ourselves, dependence on the mills
would remain. We did not feel that
we could render any service to the
country by continuing as agents of
Indian spinning mills.
90
We could get neither a spinning
wheel nor a spinner to teach us
how to spin.
I asked every chance visitor to
the Ashram, who was likely to
possess some information about
hand-spinning, about the art.
In the year 1917 I was taken by
my Gujarati friends to preside at
the Broach Educational Conference.
It was here that I discovered
that remarkable lady Gangabehn
Majmudar. To her I poured out my
grief about the charkha, and she
lightened my burden by a promise
to search for the spinning wheel
till she found it.
At last after no end of wandering
in Gujarat, Gangabehn found
the spinning wheel in Vijapur in
the Baroda State. Quite a number
of people there had spinning
wheels in their homes, but had
long since put them away as useless
lumber. They expressed to
Gangabehn their readiness to resume
spinning, if someone promised
to provide them with a regular
supply of slivers, and to buy the
yarn spun by them. Gangabehn
53. FAREWELL
communicated the joyful news to
me. The providing of slivers was
found to be a difficult task. On my
mentioning the thing to the late
Umar Sobani, he solved the difficulty
by immediately undertaking
to send a sufficient supply of slivers
from his mill.
I did not like continuously receiving
slivers from him. Moreover,
it seemed to me to be fundamentally
wrong to use mill-slivers.
If one could use mill-slivers, why
not use mill-yarn as well? Surely
no mills supplied slivers to the ancients.
How did they make their
slivers then? With these thoughts
in my mind I suggested to
Gangabehn to find carders who
could supply slivers. She confidently
undertook the task. She engaged
a carder who was prepared
to card cotton. He demanded
thirty-five rupees, if not much
more, per month. I considered no
price too high at the time. She
trained a few youngsters to make
slivers out of the carded cotton.
Thus the spinning wheel gained a
rapid footing in the Ashram.
The time has now come to bring
these chapters to a close.
My life from this point onward
has been so public that there is
hardly anything about it that
people do not know.
In fact my pen instinctively refuses
to proceed further.
91
It is not without regret that I
have to take leave of the reader.
I set a high value on my experiments.
I do not know whether I
have been able to do justice to
them. I can only say that I have
spared no pains to give a faithful
narrative. To describe truth as it
has appeared to me, has been my
ceaseless effort. The exercise has
given me great mental peace, because
it has been my fond hope
that it might bring faith in Truth
and Ahimsa to waverers.
